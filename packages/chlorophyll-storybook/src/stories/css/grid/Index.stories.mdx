# Grid

Green uses Bootstrap's grid system which relies on a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system comes together can be found at [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/).

**New to or unfamiliar with flexbox?** [Read this CSS Tricks flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background) for background, terminology, guidelines, and code snippets.
