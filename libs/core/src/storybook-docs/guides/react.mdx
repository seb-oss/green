React 19 has built-in support for web components, and Green Core automatically generates typed JSX wrappers for all components and icons. This means you can use the components directly in your JSX templates.

For example:

```ts
import { GdsButton } from '@sebgroup/green-core/react'
```

Then, in your JSX template:

```tsx
<GdsButton rank="secondary" onClick={() => console.log('Hello')}>
  Click me!
</GdsButton>
```

These imports are tree-shakable and the underlying web components will be defined automatically on first use.

## Transitional styles

If you are using the 2016 design, you need to add transitional styles. You can import them like this and register separately:

```ts
import * as ButtonStyles from '@sebgroup/green-core/components/button/button.trans.styles.js'
ButtonStyles.register()
```

Then, you can use the component in your JSX template as shown above.

## React 18 and older

React 18 and older versions do not have proper built-in support for web components. You can still use Green Core components in your React application, but you need to provide a wrapper for each component.
You can use the `createComponent` function from `@lit/react` to create these wrappers.

Here is an example:

```ts
import React from 'react'
import { createComponent } from '@lit/react'

import { GdsButton as GdsButtonClass } from '@sebgroup/green-core/component/button/index.js'
import { getScopedTagName } from '@sebgroup/green-core/scoping'

import * as ButtonStyles from '@sebgroup/green-core/components/button/button.trans.styles.js'
ButtonStyles.register()

export const GdsButton = createComponent({
  tagName: getScopedTagName('gds-button'),
  elementClass: GdsButtonClass,
  react: React,
  events: { onClick: 'click' }, // Event callbacks need to be explicitly mapped to DOM events
})
```

Then you can just use `<GdsButton />` like a regular React component.
