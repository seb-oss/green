# Troubleshooting common problems

This guide will help you troubleshoot common problems that you might encounter when developing with Green.

## Component is not rendering

If a component is not rendering, there are a few things you can check:

- Make sure that the component is imported correctly. For example, if you are using the button component, you need
  to import it like this:

```ts
import '@sebgroup/green-core/components/button/index.js'
```

- Check that [custom element scoping](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/core/?path=/docs/concepts-scoping--docs) is
  correctly applied. If you inspect the component in the browser, you should see that the custom element name has a
  version suffix, like this:`<gds-button-VERSIONSTRING>`.

  If the version suffix is missing, it usually means one of two things:

  - The component is not imported correctly. See previous point.
  - The suffix is not being applied in your template. There are a few different ways to accomplish this, depending on
    what framework you are working with. Check the examples in the [Welcome](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/core/?path=/docs/welcome--docs)
    docs to see how it is done in Lit, React and Angular.

  When the component is properly initialized, it should have an attribute called `gds-element`, and a shadow root
  attached, similar to this:

  <img
    width="335"
    alt="image"
    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5918f952-4713-4ee8-a298-2ae9b71c45fa"
  />

## Component is not styled correctly

### I'm trying to get 2016 design

<details>
First, check that you have loaded and registered Transistional Styles accoring to the examples in the [Welcome](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/core/?path=/docs/welcome--docs) docs.

If you are still having issues, continue reading.

A common cause of styling issues with Green Core components is that [transitional styles](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/core/?path=/docs/concepts-transitional-styles--docs)
often rely on [Chlorophyll](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/chlorophyll) CSS variables being in scope.

When you already have the Chlorophyll CSS loaded on the page, this is usually not an issue, but if you try to use the components in isolation, you might run into this problem.

There are two ways to solve it:

- Make sure that the Chlorophyll CSS is loaded on the page. This can be done by importing SCSS or precompiled CSS from the `@sebgroup/chlorophyll` package.
- Use the `<gds-theme>` component. This component will automatically load the Chlorophyll CSS variables, and make sure that they are in scope.

  You can use the `<gds-theme>` component like this:

```ts
// Import the theme component
import '@sebgroup/green-core/components/theme/index.js'

// Import and register transitional styles for the theme component
// This is important, as it will make sure that the actual Chlorophyll CSS variables are loaded
import * as themeTransStyles from '@sebgroup/green-core/components/theme/theme.trans.styles.ts'
themeTransStyles.register()
```

Then use it in your template:

```html
<gds-theme>
  <!-- Green Core components here -->
</gds-theme>
```
</details>

### I'm trying to get 2023 design

<details>
The 2023 design is the default design for Green Core components, so if you are not seeing the correct styling, here are some things to check.

If all instances of the component should use 2023 design in your app, then check that Transitional Styles **are not** loaded for the component at all. If they are, they will override the 2023 styles with 2016 styles. In this case, you can simply remove the importing and registering of the transitional styles. This way, the component will simply use it's built-in default 2023 styles.

If some instances still need to have 2016 style, the situation is somewhat different. In this case, you need to keep the transitional styles, but you can use the `<gds-theme>` component to override the transitional styles for specific components.

```html
<gds-theme design-version="2023">
  <!-- Green Core components here will use 2023, even if they have transitional styles loaded -->
</gds-theme>
```

#### It's still not working...
If it's an older component, it could be that it doesn't have the 2023 design yet.
In this case, since the component may need to be updated or a new one written, reach out to the Green Core team for help.

Also, all of the information here only applies to components from the `@sebgroup/green-core` package. If you are using components from the Angular or React package that still only use Chlorophyll styling, this does not apply.
</details>

## Errors in the console

- `Class constructor LitElement cannot be invoked without 'new'`

  This error usually occurs when incorrect transformations are applied in the build step.

  Make sure that:

  - The `@babel/preset-env` is configured correctly in your Babel configuration.
  - The compile target for both Babel and TypeScript is set to at least `es2015`.
  - You are using Typescript version 5.0 or later.

## Problems testing with Jest

The most common source of issues when tesing with Jest is that, by default, Jest does not apply babel transformations to modules in `node_modules`.
Because of this, you need to configure Jest to transform the Green Core modules. Core already have a configureation for this that you can import
and apply to your Jest configuration.

Check the docs for React or Angular for more details on how to do this:

- [React](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/react/?path=/docs/testing--docs)
- [Angular](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/angular/?path=/docs/testing--docs)
