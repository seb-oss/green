# How to contribute

If you need a component or feature, or found a bug that needs fixing, you are very welcome to open a Pull Request!

In general, any new components developed for Green should be built as web components in Green Core using Lit.

For general information on the contribution process, see the [Green Design System contribution guide](https://github.com/sebgroup/green/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Understanding how Green Core works

Before you attempt to build a component for Green Core, please read through all of the articles under both the Concepts and Contributing sections in this storybook. That will help you understand how Green Core is built and why it is built the way it is.
