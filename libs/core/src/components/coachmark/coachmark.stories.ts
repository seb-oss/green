/**
 * [Source code](https://github.com/sebgroup/green/tree/main/libs/core/src/components/coachmark)
 *
 * Coachmarks are contextual tips that focus on making the user
 * aware of a new feature, the benefits of an existing one or a moved feature within an interface.
 *
 * the component is primarily a container that follows the targeted element.
 * the tooltip will be invisible and disabled if another element covered the targeted element or its simply out of view
 * the tooltip will close and dispatch a CustomEvent of "tooltipClosed"
 *
 * Note: the component can only view one coachmark at the time therefore the tooltip won't be
 * rendered in second storybook panel and testing the tooltip behaviour will be in the first panel only
 *
