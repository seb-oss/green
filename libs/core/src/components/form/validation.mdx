<h1>Form validation</h1>

Green Core components have built-in support for form validation. The validation feature is built on top of the
browsers native validation features, using ElementInternals and Constraint Validation API.

## Usage

Validation is configured by adding a validator to a form element. A validator is an object that implements the
`GdsValidator` interface:

```typescript
export interface GdsValidator {
  /**
   * Validate the form control element. Should return the validity state and an optional validation message.
   */
  validate(element: GdsFormControlElement): [ValidityState, string] | undefined
}
```

Here is how you can use it in a component in a Lit element:

```html
<gds-dropdown
  label="Pick a pet"
  .validator=${{
    validate: (el: GdsDropdown) => {
      if (el.value !== 'cat')
        return [
          { ...el.validity, valid: false, customError: true },
          'Only cats are allowed!',
        ]
    },
  }}
>
  <gds-option>Pick favorite</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="dog">Dog</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="cat">Cat</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="fish">Fish</gds-option>
</gds-dropdown>
```

The return value of the `validate` method should be a tuple of the validity state (as a
[`ValidityState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object) and a validation message.
The `ValidityState` object communicates the cause of the validation failure to the user agent. If the control was
initially in a valid state, setting it to invalid will also cause it to emit a `invalid` event.

Additionally, if the validity state changes due to the validate method, a `gds-validity-state` event will be dispatched. This event is not emitted when validity is explicitly set.

The validator is executed when the value of the form control changes, and when the form emits a submit event.

## Using other validation methods

The validity state can also be explicitly set by setting the property `invalid` to `true`, or setting the `aria-invalid`
attribute to `true`. This is useful when working with other validation libraries, such as Angular reactive forms.

In this case the validation message can be supplied via the `message` slot (usually, but depends on the component),
for example:

```html
<gds-dropdown *nggCoreElement label="Pick a pet" [invalid]="isInvalid">
  <span slot="message">{{ invalidMessage }}</span>
  ...options...
</gds-dropdown>
```

## Displaying a validation summary

To display a validation summary, you can use the `gds-form-summary` component. This component automatically subscribes to
changes in its parent form and displays a list of validation issues. This only needs the `invalid` state to be true, so it
should work with any validation framework, as long as both the summary component and form components are children of a form
element.

```html
<form>
  <!-- Form controls here -->
  <gds-form-summary></gds-form-summary>
</form>
```
