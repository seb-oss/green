<h1>Form validation</h1>

Green Core components have built-in support for form validation. The validation feature is built on top of the
browsers native validation features, using ElementInternals and Constraint Validation API.

## Usage

Validation is configured by adding a validator to a form element. A validator is an object that implements the
`GdsValidator` interface:

```typescript
export interface GdsValidator {
  /**
   * Validate the form control element. Should return the validity state and an optional validation message.
   */
  validate(element: GdsFormControlElement): [ValidityState, string] | undefined
}
```

Here is how you can use it in a component in a Lit element:

```html
<gds-dropdown
  label="Pick a pet"
  .validator=${{
    validate: (el: GdsDropdown) => {
      if (el.value !== 'cat')
        return [
          { ...el.validity, valid: false, customError: true },
          'Only cats are allowed!',
        ]
    },
  }}
>
  <gds-option>Pick favorite</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="dog">Dog</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="cat">Cat</gds-option>
  <gds-option value="fish">Fish</gds-option>
</gds-dropdown>
```

The return value of the `validate` method should be a tuple of the validity state (as a
[`ValidityState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object) and a validation message.
The `ValidityState` object communicates the cause of the validation failure to the user agent. If the control was
initially in a valid state, setting it to invalid will also cause it to emit a `invalid` event.

The validator is executed when the value of the form control changes, and when the form emits a submit event.

## Using other validation methods

The validity state can also be explicitly set by setting the property `invalid` to `true`, or setting the `aria-invalid`
attribute to `true`. This is useful when working with other validation libraries, such as Angular reactive forms.

In this case the validation message can be supplied via the `message` slot (usually, but depends on the component),
for example:

```html
<gds-dropdown *nggCoreElement label="Pick a pet" [invalid]="isInvalid">
  <span slot="message">{{ invalidMessage }}</span>
  ...options...
</gds-dropdown>
```

## Displaying a validation summary

To display a validation summary, you can use the `gds-form-summary` component. This component automatically subscribes to
changes in its parent form and displays a list of validation issues. This only needs the `invalid` state to be true, so it
should work with any validation framework, as long as both the summary component and form components are children of a form
element.

```html
<form>
  <!-- Form controls here -->
  <gds-form-summary></gds-form-summary>
</form>
```
