# Using Green Core form controls with Angular

The form control components from Green Core can be used in Angular, either with just the standard Angular functionality, or using helper directives from the Green Angular library.

> If you want to look at a complete example, you can check out [this code](https://github.com/seb-oss/green/tree/main/apps/angular-lib-dev/src/app/form) from our Angular testing app.

Let's look at `<gds-input>` as an example in this guide. The same principles apply to all form controls in Green Core.

The most basic way to use a form control is to just include it in the template like this:

```html
<gds-input *nggCoreElement label="My label"></gds-input>
```
*Ps. Check [Get Started](/docs/get-started--docs) for details on how to import and set up the stuff you need.*

Of course, this is not very useful by itself. You probably want to bind the control to a datamodel of some kind too.

## Reactive forms

The recommended way to use form controls in Angular is to use reactive forms. This is a way to define the form in code, and bind the form controls to the form model.

You bind form controls to the form model by using the `formControlName` directive. Here is an example of how to use `<gds-input>` in a reactive form:

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm">
  <gds-input
    *nggCoreElement
    ngDefaultControl
    label="My label"
    formControlName="myInput">
  </gds-input>
</form>
```

Notice the `ngDefaultControl` directive. This is there to convinde angular that this is indeed an input element, since Angular has no idea what an `<gds-input>` is otherwise.

### Validation

Ok, great! But what about validation?

Reactive form validators can be specified either in the form model, or directly in the template. Here is an example of how to add a required validator to the input:

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm">
  <gds-input
    *nggCoreElement
    ngDefaultControl
    label="My label"
    formControlName="myInput"
    required
    [invalid]="myForm.get('myInput').invalid"
    errorMessage="This field is required">
  </gds-input>
</form>
```

In this example, the `required` attribute, which is a standard HTML attribute, will inform reactive forms to add a required validator to the form control.
Then, to actually change the style of the control to match the validity state, we add the boolean `invalid` attribute. This is a custom attribute in the `<gds-input>` component used to control it's internal validity state and associated styling.
Finally, the `errorMessage` attribute, another custom attribute, is used to control the error message text that renderls below the input when the control is invalid.

### Using NggCoreRenderer and NggCoreFormsModule

As you can see, even this basic example is starting to look a bit cluttered, with all the different attributes and directives. To make it a bit cleaner, you can use some helper features from Green Angular.

First, you can change your module from using the `NggCoreWrapperModule` to using the `NggCoreRendererFactory`. This will automatically handle scoping, so that you can get rid of the `*nggCoreElement` directive.

Secondly, you can import Green Angular's `NggCoreFormsModule`. This will add a custom controlValueAccesor to green core form controls, so that you can use them in reactive forms without the need for the `ngDefaultControl` directive. It will also handle the invalid state automatically.

In your module:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyFormComponent],
  imports: [
    NggCoreFormsModule, // This allows us to use Green Core form controls just like native HTML form controls
    CommonModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    FormsModule,
  ],
  exports: [],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  providers: [
    {
      // By providing our custom renderer factory, we can use <gds-*> elements without any extra directives.
      // The NggCoreRenderer will handle element name scoping automatically.
      provide: RendererFactory2,
      useClass: NggCoreRendererFactory,
    },
  ],
})
export class MyFormModule {}
```

With these two changes, the template will look like this:

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm">
  <gds-input
    label="My label"
    formControlName="myInput"
    required
    errorMessage="This field is required">
  </gds-input>
</form>
```

Much cleaner!
