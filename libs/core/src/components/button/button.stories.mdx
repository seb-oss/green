# Button

## Button variants

Buttons exist in three different variants, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary

<Canvas>
  <gds-button>Primary</gds-button>
  <gds-button variant="secondary">Secondary</gds-button>
  <gds-button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button sets

Each variant can belong to one of three sets, Neutral, Positive and Negative

<Canvas>
  <story-grid>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button>Neutral primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button variant="secondary">Neutral secondary</gds-button>
      <gds-button variant="tertiary">Neutral tertiary</gds-button>
    </story-row>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button set="positive">Positive primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button set="positive" variant="secondary">
        Positive secondary
      </gds-button>
      <gds-button set="positive" variant="tertiary">
        Positive tertiary
      </gds-button>
    </story-row>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button set="negative">Negative primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button set="negative" variant="secondary">
        Negative secondary
      </gds-button>
      <gds-button set="negative" variant="tertiary">
        Negative tertiary
      </gds-button>
    </story-row>
  </story-grid>
</Canvas>

## Button sizes

Buttons can be small, medium or large. The default size is medium.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button size="small">Small</gds-button>
  <gds-button>Medium</gds-button>
  <gds-button size="large">Large</gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button with icon

Buttons can have an icon on the left or right side of the text. These are called leading or trailing icons, and are added by placing a `gds-icon` component in either the `lead` or `trail` slot.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button>
    <gds-icon slot="lead" name="arrow-down" />
    Leading icon
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button>
    Trailing icon
    <gds-icon slot="trail" name="arrow-up" />
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button with icon only

If a single `gds-icon` is the only child of a button, it will render as a circular icon button.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button size="small">
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button>
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button size="large">
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The buttons support a disabled state, but in general, it should not be used. It can be hard for the user to understand why the button is disabled, so it is often better to keep the button clickable and then show an error message
instead.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button disabled>Primary</gds-button>
  <gds-button variant="secondary" set="positive" disabled>
    Secondary
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button variant="tertiary" disabled>
    Tertiary
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>
