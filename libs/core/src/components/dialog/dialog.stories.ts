/**
 * You can listen to the `gds-show`, `gds-close` and `gds-ui-state` events to know when the dialog is opened or closed.
 *
 * When `close()` or `show()` is called without a parameter, the event will not be emitted. If a parameter is passed, the
 * event will be emitted with the parameter as the event detail. Also when any of the built-in methods are used to open or
 * close the dialog, the event will be emitted with the parameter as the event detail.
 *
 * All the emitted events will have a `detail` object with a reason property that can be used to determine the reason for the event.
 *
 * Possible reasons are:
 * - `btn-close`: The dialog was closed by the user clicking the close button.
 * - `btn-cancel`: The dialog was closed by the user clicking the default cancel button.
 * - `btn-ok`: The dialog was closed by the user clicking the default OK button.
 * - `native-close`: The dialog was closed by an action native to the HTML dialog element, such as pressing the Escape key.
 * - `click-outside`: The dialog was closed by the user clicking outside the dialog.
 * - `slotted-trigger`: The dialog was opened by the user clicking the slotted trigger button.
 *
 * The reason can also be a custom string supplied when calling the `close()` or `show()` methods.
 *
 * ### Preventing close
 * The `gds-ui-state` event can be cancelled by calling `preventDefault()` on the event to prevent the dialog from closing. Presently, only the `gds-ui-state` event can be cancelled in this way.
