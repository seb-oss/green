# Date picker

Date pickers simplify the task of selecting a date in a visual representation of a calendar.

The date picker in Green Core mimics the behaviour of the native date input element as it is
implemented in Chromium browsers.

The input field shows three parts of the date: the day, the month and the year. The user can
navigate between these parts using the arrow keys. The user can also navigate between the parts
by clicking on them or tabbing. When a part has focus, it can be changed using the arrow keys or
by typing a number.

Clicking the calendar icon opens a popover with a calendar view where a date can be chosen.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
    <gds-datepicker
      label="Label"
      onchange="document.getElementById('chosen-date').innerHTML = this.value?.toISOString() || 'None'"
    ></gds-datepicker>
    Chosen date: <span id="chosen-date">None</span>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Basic usage

The date picker takes a `label` attribute for setting the label text, and has two slots for adding
additional information.

The `sub-label` slot sits between the label and the input, and the `message` slot sits below the
input. The `message` slot is used to display instructions and/or validation errors.

When the value is changed by a user, a `change` event is fired.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
    <gds-datepicker label="Using slots" onchange="console.log(this.value)">
      <span slot="sub-label">
        A sub-label can be added as additional description
      </span>
      <span slot="message">
        Instructive message. Will turn red if there is a validation error
      </span>
    </gds-datepicker>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Week numbers

Use the `show-week-numbers` attribute to show a week numbers column in the calendar view.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
    <gds-datepicker
      label="With week numbers"
      show-week-numbers
    ></gds-datepicker>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Min and max dates

Use the `min` and `max` attributes to set the minimum and maximum dates that can be selected. Dates outside of this range will be disabled in the calendar view.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
    <gds-datepicker
      label="Using min and max dates"
      min="2022-11-11"
      max="2024-02-20"
    ></gds-datepicker>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Disabled dates

Set the `disable-weekends` attribute to disable weekends (saturdays and sundays) in the calendar view.

Additionally, `disabled-dates` can be used to disable specific dates.

- When set via the `disabled-dates` attribute, this should be a comma-separated list of date strings that can be parsed by the Javscript `Date()` constructor.
- When set via the `disabledDates` property, it should be an array of Javascript `Date` objects.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
    <gds-datepicker
      label="Disabled weekends"
      disabled-weekends
      disabled-dates="2024-03-08, 2024-04-12, 2024-03-18, 2024-03-19"
    ></gds-datepicker>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Input field size

The date picker has two sizes: `small` and `medium`. The default size is `medium`.

Optionally, the label can be hidden by using the `hide-label` attribute.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles(), display: 'inline-block' }}>
    <gds-datepicker
      label="A small datepicker"
      hide-label
      size="small"
    ></gds-datepicker>
  </div>
</Canvas>
