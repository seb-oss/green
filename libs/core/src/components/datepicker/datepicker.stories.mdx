# Date picker

Date pickers simplify the task of selecting a date in a visual representation of a calendar.

The date picker in Green Core mimics the behaviour of the native date input element as it is
implemented in Chromium browsers.

The input field shows three parts of the date: the day, the month and the year. The user can
navigate between these parts using the arrow keys. The user can also navigate between the parts
by clicking on them or tabbing. When a part has focus, it can be changed using the arrow keys or
by typing a number.

Clicking the calendar icon opens a popover with a calendar view where a date can be chosen.

<Canvas>
<div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
<gds-datepicker label="Label" onchange="document.getElementById('chosen-date').innerHTML = this.value?.toISOString() || 'None'"></gds-datepicker>
Chosen date: <span id="chosen-date">None</span>
</div>
</Canvas>

## Basic usage

The date picker takes a `label` attribute for setting the label text, and has two slots for adding
additional information.

The `sub-label` slot sits between the label and the input, and the `message` slot sits below the
input. The `message` slot is used to display instructions and/or validation errors.

When the value is changed by a user, a `change` event is fired.

<Canvas>
<div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
<gds-datepicker label="Label" onchange="console.log(this.value)">
  <span slot="sub-label">A sub-label can be added as additional description</span>
  <span slot="message">Instructive message. Will turn red if there is a validation error</span>
</gds-datepicker>
</div>
</Canvas>

## Other attributes

In this example, all the available attributes are used.

<Canvas>
<div style={{ dummy: registerTransitionalStyles() }}>
<gds-datepicker
  label="Label"
  onchange="console.log(this.value)"
  min="2022-11-11"
  max="2024-02-20"
  showWeekNumbers
  small>
  <span slot="sub-label">A sub-label can be added as additional description</span>
  <span slot="message">Instructive message. Will turn red if there is a validation error</span>
</gds-datepicker>
</div>
</Canvas>
