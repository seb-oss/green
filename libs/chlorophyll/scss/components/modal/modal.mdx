## Modal variants

Green currently provides three different variants of the modal - **dialog**, **aside** (aka slide out) and **fullscreen** (aka take over).

### Dialogue

Dialog modals are typically used for confirming actions or displaying information that the user must act on before continuing with intended flow.

### Slide-out

Aside modals or slide out modals are typically used for displaying details regarding some information, i.e. transaction details in a list of transactions. It slides in from the right on desktop and from the bottom of the viewport on smaller screens like mobile devices.

### Slide-out variants

#### Slide-out 768

<Canvas of={ModalStories.SlideOut768} />

#### Slide-out 960

<Canvas of={ModalStories.SlideOut960} />

### Fullscreen

Fullscreen modals or takeovers are typically used for wizards or for complex flows requiring a lot of screen estate.
