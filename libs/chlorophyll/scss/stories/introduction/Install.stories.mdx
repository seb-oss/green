# Install
We recommend installing the lib corresponding with the framework you're using even though the number of components they provide at the time of writing is limited. We currently support both Angular and React.

**Please note** - you don't have to install chlorophyll which is the core lib containing common css if you install our libs for Angular and React as they both have a dependency to chlorophyll.

If you need charts, we have libs for that too based on [Billboardjs](https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/). Same thing here, install the package for the framework you're using.

## Angular

**Components**
```
npm install @sebgroup/green-angular --save
```

**Charts**
```
npm install @sebgroup/green-angular-charts --save
```


## React

**Components**
```
npm install @sebgroup/green-react --save
```

**Charts**
```
npm install @sebgroup/green-react-charts --save
```

## Pure CSS/SCSS
```
npm install @sebgroup/chlorophyll --save
```
