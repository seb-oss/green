# Use

## With Angular

We recommend setting up your Angular project to use scss (SASS) for css preprocessing.

Once configured to use scss, it's just a matter of including the chlorophyll lib to your main styles file, typically it would be `styles.scss` located at the root of the `src` folder unless you've changed it.

### Add scss

```sass
// project/src/styles.scss
@use "~@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss";
```

### Have other needs?
More examples and use cases coming soon! In the meantime create an [issue over at github](https://github.com/sebgroup/green/issues)
