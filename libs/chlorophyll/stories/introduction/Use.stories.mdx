# Use

It's generally not recommended to use Chlorophyll directly. Instead you should use one of Greens component libraries which provides pre-made components for Angular and React.

## Angular

For detailed information on how to use with Angular, go here: [Angular Storybook](https://sebgroup.github.io/green/latest/angular/)

## React

For detailed information on how to use with React, go here: [React Storybook](https://sebgroup.github.io/green/latest/react/)

## Selective imports

If you only need a few components, you can selectively import the things that you need.

First, you need to add some base styles that all components depend on:

```scss
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/themes/' as themes;
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/reset/' as reset;
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/fonts/';
```

You will likely also need to use utility classes and grid (and some components use these interally):

```scss
@use '@sebgroup/hlorophyll/scss/components/utility';
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/grid';
```

If you use any form components, you may also need to import the form module:

```scss
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/form';
```

Then you can import the individual components that you need:

```scss
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/tabs-bar';
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/button';
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/dropdown';
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/datepicker';
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/context-menu';
// ...etc
```
