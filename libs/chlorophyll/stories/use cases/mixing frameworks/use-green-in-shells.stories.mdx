# Use Green for MFE in shell application

Whenever you create an MFE (Micro Front End) that will be used or incorporated in another application (shell) you need to consider CSS leakage to avoid the CSS from the MFE to affect the shell (and the other way around, which is another topic).

### Scoping CSS

The example below is for Angular but the same principle applies to other frameworks as well. We recommend setting up Angular with scss and that you add global styles to `styles.scss` located in the `src` folder of your project.
It could look something like this:

**styles.scss**

```css
/* Add use-green scope i.e. ability to use (`.use-green`) */
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/use-green-scope';

/* Import green and scope it to `.use-green` class and our root element (by default app-root in angular but you should change it).
We use app-root here to make sure no CSS is applied to other elements except our MFE which will be rendered inside the `<app-root>` tag.
This goes for any custom CSS we add as well, we should add inside our root element selector.
Note if MFE or component is rendered using shadow DOM this is not necessary */

app-root.use-green {
  /* declare parts to include in a separate file that you import (to scope it to .use-green) */
  @import './green'; /* custom import of green (see example file below) */
}
```

**green.scss**

```css
/* Custom import of green */
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss'; /* if yoy want all of green */
/* @use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss/components/button'; */ /* if you only need specific parts like button component(s) */
```
