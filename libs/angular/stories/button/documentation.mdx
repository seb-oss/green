# Button

The regular `<button>` element has all the functionality required for a simple button, and is accessible and semantically correct by default, so there's little reason to wrap it in a custom Angular component.

## A simple button in Green/Angular
<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-button--default" />
</Canvas>

## Other button variants
Changing the variant of a button is as simple as applying a class:
<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-button--primary" />
</Canvas>

For more information on how to use buttons in Green, have a look at the [Chlorophyll documention for buttons](https://sebgroup.github.io/green/latest/chlorophyll/?path=/docs/components-form-elements-button--button).
