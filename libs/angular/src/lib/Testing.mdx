# Testing Angular applications built with Green

## Default Jasmine + Karma setup

The default Jasmine + Karma setup should work out of the box with Green. For more info, read the official Angular documentation on [testing](https://angular.io/guide/testing).

## Jest

Because some of the components in Green are Web Components, and Jest runs in a Node environment, Jest needs some extra configuration to work with Green. For example, if you run into errors like `Jest encountered an unexpected token`, this is probably the reason.

To make this as seamless as possible, Green provides some pre-packaged configuration that you can apply to your Jest configuration.

First, you need to make sure your Jest config is written in Javascript and not Typescript, or convert it if it is. If you have a `jest.config.ts` file, rename it to `jest.config.cjs`.

Then, change the `const config = { ... }` to `module.exports = { ... }`. Also remove the `export default config` line.

Then, you can extend your configuration like this:

```js
// import green jest config
const greenJestConfig = require('@sebgroup/green-core/jest-config')

// apply the green jest config
module.exports = greenJestConfig.apply({
  // Your existing config, for example:
  clearMocks: true,
  coverageProvider: 'v8',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  preset: 'jest-preset-angular',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/setup-jest.ts'],
})
```

This will apply the necessary configuration to make Jest work with Green. Specifically, it will add suitable `transformIgnorePatterns` and run setup that mocks various browser APIs that are not available in Node.

Now you should be able to use jest normally.

### Interacting with Green web components in a test

To interact with Green web components in a test, you can import types from the `@sebgroup/green-core` package, and use that when querying the DOM.

```ts
// Import types from Green core:
import type { GdsDropdown } from '@sebgroup/green-core'

// Then in your test:
it('should display correct value in dropdown', async () => {
  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent)
  fixture.detectChanges()
  const compiled = fixture.nativeElement as HTMLElement

  // Query the DOM using the GdsDropdown type
  const dropdown = compiled.querySelector<GdsDropdown>(
    '[gds-element="gds-dropdown"]', // This is the attribute that Green components use to identify themselves, since the element name itself will have a scoping suffix.
  )!

  // Now you can access properties of the underlying component, such as setting value
  dropdown.value = 'some_value'

  // Wait for both `updateComplete` and `setTimeout` (for the next event loop tick)
  // This is usually enough to let the Web Component work out it's internal state
  await dropdown.updateComplete
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0))

  // Now we can check with expect as usual
  expect(dropdown?.displayValue).toContain('Some Value')
})
```

Check the component's API documentation for more information on how to interact with the components.
