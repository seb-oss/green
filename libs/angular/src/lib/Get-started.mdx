# Angular Green

## Install

If you are using the latest version of Angular, you can simply install `@sebgroup/green-angular` like this:

```
npm install @sebgroup/green-angular --save
```

However, because `@sebgroup/green-angular` has a peer dependency to `@angular/cdk`, and Angular is very picky about which versions go together, if you use an older version of Angular you need to explicitly install the matching version of `@angular/cdk` as well.

For example, for Angular 17:

```
npm install @angular/cdk@~17.0.0 @sebgroup/green-angular --save
```

Currently, our aim is to support the oldest LTS version of Angular and up. You can check currently supported versions [here](https://angular.dev/reference/releases#actively-supported-versions)

## Import module

Each component in Green Angular is exported as a separate module. We recommend importing only the component modules that you need:

```ts
import { NggDropdownModule } from '@sebgroup/green-angular/src/lib/dropdown'
import { NggContextMenuModule } from '@sebgroup/green-angular/src/lib/context-menu'

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [
    ...
    NggDropdownModule,
    NggContextMenuModule
  ],
  exports: [
    NggModule
  ]
})
export class SharedModule {}
```

## Import styling

We recommend setting up your Angular project to use scss (SASS) for css preprocessing.

Once configured to use scss, it's just a matter of including the scss to your main styles file, typically it would be `styles.scss` located at the root of the `src` folder unless you've changed it.

### Add scss

`{project}/src/styles.scss`

```css
// import base styles from @sebgroup/chlorophyll
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss';
```

**Note:** Depending on you bundler, you may need to configure the font path by setting the `$font-path` variable:

```scss
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss' with (
  $font-path: '@sebgroup/fonts/fonts'
);
```

### Selective imports

I you are only using a few components, it's better to selectively import the components you need. This will reduce the size of the final css bundle.

Check out the example on [this page](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/chlorophyll/?path=/docs/get-started-use--page).
