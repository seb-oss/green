# Install

```
npm install @sebgroup/green-angular --save
```

# Import module
We recommend import `NggModule` (or just the module you need for Angular Green) into a shared module eg. `SharedModule` that can be imported into other, preferably lazy loaded modules when needed.
```ts
import { NggModule } from '@sebgroup/green-angular'

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [
    ...
    NggModule
  ],
  exports: [
    NggModule
  ]
})
export class SharedModule {}
```

# Import styling
We recommend setting up your Angular project to use scss (SASS) for css preprocessing.

Once configured to use scss, it's just a matter of including the scss to your main styles file, typically it would be `styles.scss` located at the root of the `src` folder unless you've changed it.

### Add scss
`{project}/src/styles.scss`

```css
// import base styles from green/chlorophyll
@use '~@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss';
```

### Have other needs?
More examples and use cases coming soon! In the meantime create an [issue over at github](https://github.com/sebgroup/green/issues)
