# Green Tokens

Design tokens for **Green Design System**. The design system at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB). 

## How it works

All of the design tokens and assets are in this repository. Updates to this repo need to go through the Green Core Team which governs the design system.

### Style Dictionary

Tokens can be transformed with [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) so they can be used in your preferred platform.

To get started, run
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run build
```

The yarn build task is what performs the style dictionary build steps to generate the files for each platform. Every time you change something in the style dictionary, like changing colors or adding design tokens, you will have to run this command again to generate the files.

## Support

If you need help with tokens or anything regarding the *Green Design System* reach out in SEB's internal Teams channel called *Green Design System* or send an email to [vilhelm.sjolander@seb.se](mailto:vilhelm.sjolander@seb.se)
