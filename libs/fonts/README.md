## Green Design System Fonts

This repository contains SEBs primary font SEB SansSerif.

This package contains the GDS version of SEB SansSerif (`SEB SansSerif GDS`), which is intended for use in a web context with the Green Design System. The package also contains an older version called `SEBSansSerif` which is considered deprecated.

The two version differ slightly in line-height, kerning and available weights.

## Getting started

```
npm install @sebgroup/fonts --save
```

Include `@sepgroup/fonts/scss/gds-fonts.scss` or `@sepgroup/fonts/css/fonts.css` to your project. When importing the SCSS file, you can set the `$seb-font-path` variable to suite your needs. Check the source code to see how it is applied.
