## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 3c7eee0: Update to new version of SEB SansSerif, and remove old version

  The transional 'SEB SansSerif GDS' font-famliy name is removed in this update, and the default 'SEB SansSerif' font-family is replaced by the new updated one.

  The main differences in the update is the addition of the `book (450)` font-weight, and various rendering adjustments, such as line-centering.

  This is versioned as a major release, since there could potentially be visual breaking changes, such as some text appearing misaliged. It is recommended to carefully examine all parts of the application after this update.
