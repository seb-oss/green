# Link

Simple link component

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Default} />


## Link on backgrounds

Links will by default have their color adjusted and use the color which gives best contrast against background of immediate parent.
Currently, it works with all the intent colors using the pattern \*-\{intent} e.g. bg-info, alert-success, alert-danger etc.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.OnBackground} />


## Style links as button

Sometimes you want to use links but style them as buttons, just add the class button and optionally a variant like primary or ghost and voilà -
now you've got a link which looks and behaves like a button!

<Canvas of={LinkStories.AsButton} />


## Black variant

The black variant link is mostly used when the link is a stand alone, but the blue link can also be used there.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Secondary} />


### Available props

<Controls />
