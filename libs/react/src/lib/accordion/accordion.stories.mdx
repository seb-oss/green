# Accordion

An accordion lets users show and hide sections of related content on a page.

<Accordion
  items={[
    {
      label: 'First accordion heading',
      subLabel: 'First accordion sublabel',
      content: (
        <>
          <p>
            In such a case, we can debounce the resize handling and thus the
            re-rendering. This will mean to throttle or wait between calls to
            our handleResize function. There are solid debounce implementations.
            Let's add a short and simple one to our example
          </p>
          <a href="#">And this is a link</a>
        </>
      ),
      labelElementLevel: 2,
    },
    {
      label: 'Second accordion heading',
      content: (
        <>
          <p>
            When adding an event listener, such as we are for the resize event,
            we should make sure to clean up after ourselves. In the example so
            far, we haven't, and that could cause our app problems later.
          </p>
          <a href="#">And this is a link</a>
        </>
      ),
      labelElementLevel: 2,
    },
    {
      label: 'Third accordion heading',
      subLabel: 'Third accordion sublabel',
      content: (
        <>
          <p>This is a paragraph in the thrid accordion.</p>
          <a href="#">This is the second link example</a>
        </>
      ),
      labelElementLevel: 2,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Description

Accordions can make information processing more effective. Best suited for plain text, lists, tables and inline links. A good example for use could be a FAQ and Terms and conditions.

## Usage

Use the accordions to "hide" information that users doesn't necessarily need to read or only need to read occasionally. If the majority of users will read it, it should be visible.
