# Testing React applications built with Green

## Jest

To test React applications using Green React, you need to add some extra configuration. Because
some of the components in Green are Web Components, and Jest runs in a Node environment, Jest
needs some browser APIs mocked. Also, the code in both the `@sebgroup/green-react` and `@sebgroup/green-core`
packages needs to be transformed by Babel before Jest can understand it. If you run into errors like
`Jest encountered an unexpected token`, this is probably the reason.

To make testing as seamless as possible, Green provides some pre-packaged configuration that you can apply to your Jest configuration.

### Babel config

First, you need to make sure that you have `babel-jest` installed in your project. If you don't, you can install it by running:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Then, create a file called `babel.config.js` in the root of your project with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { node: 'current' } }]],
}
```

### Jest config

To use the config from Green, you first need to make sure your Jest config is written in Javascript and not Typescript,
or else convert it. If you have a `jest.config.ts` file, rename it to `jest.config.cjs`.

Then, change the `const config = { ... }` to `module.exports = { ... }`. Also remove the `export default config` line.

Then, you can extend your configuration like this:

```js
// import green jest config
const greenJestConfig = require('@sebgroup/green-core/jest-config')

// apply the green jest config
module.exports = greenJestConfig.apply({
  // Your existing config, for example:
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx)$': 'babel-jest',
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  clearMocks: true,
  coverageProvider: 'v8',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/setup-jest.ts'],
})
```

With both Babel and Jest properly configured, you should be able to test your app as usual with Jest.

## Interacting with Green web components in a test

Here's an example using `@testing-library/react` to test a React component that uses a Green web component internally:

```tsx
// Import types from Green core:
import type { GdsDropdown } from '@sebgroup/green-core'

// Then in your test:
it('should render correct dropdown text', async () => {
  // arrange
  const { container } = render(<HelloWorld msg="Hello React!" />)

  // Query the DOM using the GdsDropdown type
  const dropdown = container.querySelector<GdsDropdown>(
    '[gds-element="gds-dropdown"]', // This is the attribute that Green components use to identify themselves, since the element name itself will have a scoping suffix.
  )!

  // act
  dropdown.value = '1'

  // Wait for both `updateComplete` and `setTimeout` (for the next event loop tick)
  // This is usually enough to let the Web Component work out it's internal state
  await dropdown.updateComplete
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0))

  // assert
  expect(dropdown?.displayValue).toContain('Option 1')
})
```

Check the component's API documentation for more information on how to interact with the components.
