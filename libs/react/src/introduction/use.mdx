# Use

**Note:** The preferred way to consume React components is from the Core library. Read how to do it [here](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/core/?path=/docs/guides-react--docs)

But if you need components from this storybook, read on.

## Use Components with Chlorophyll styles

React components rely on Chlorophyll styling to work as intented. Introduce the chlorophyll library to your main styles file which is typically `styles.css` located in your `src` folder

```css
// project/src/styles.scss
@use "~@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss";
```

**Note:** Depending on your bundler, you may need to configure the font path by setting the `$font-path` variable:

```css
@use '@sebgroup/chlorophyll/scss' with (
  $font-path: '@sebgroup/fonts/fonts'
);
```

### Selective imports

I you are only using a few components, it's better to selectively import the components you need. This will reduce the size of the final css bundle.

Check out the example on [this page](https://storybook.seb.io/latest/chlorophyll/?path=/docs/get-started-use--page).

## Importing a React component

Within your React project component file, you can import green-react components as below:

```ts
// project/src/ProjectComponent
import { Button } from "@sebgroup/green-react";

...

<Button variant="secondary"> Click Me </Button>
```
