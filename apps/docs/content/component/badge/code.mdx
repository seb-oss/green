- **Slots**: The badge includes a **lead** slot for adding leading content such as icons, enhancing the visual representation.
- **Disabled State**: The badge can be disabled, making it non-interactive and visually indicating its disabled state.
- **Size Control**: The badge size can be controlled via the **size** property, with options for **default** and **small**.
