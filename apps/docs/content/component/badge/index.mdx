To display a status in an intuitive and easy way.

## Usage
Badges are used to display status information with visual emphasis. They should be used sparingly to avoid information overload—when no special attention is needed, consider using plain text instead.4

If a particular badge should be even more prominent on a page, an icon can be used to draw attention. This is optional

## Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
### All the variants
We have five different variants of the badge

- <strong>Informative Default (Grey):</strong> Use this neutral badge for most cases where the information is of medium importance and doesn’t need high attention (e.g., “Pending” or “Draft”).
- <strong>Informative Blue:</strong> For neutral information that still requires slightly higher attention (e.g., “In Progress” or “New Update Available”). Use blue badges to subtly emphasize the information without signaling urgency.
- <strong>Positive Green:</strong> Use green to signal a positive or successful status (e.g., “Active” or “Completed”). This badge reinforces a favorable outcome or status.
- <strong>Warning Yellow:</strong> Use yellow for statuses that need attention but are not critical (e.g., “Low Stock” or “Expiring Soon”). It’s a cautionary indicator that suggests action might be needed.
- <strong>Critical Red:</strong> Reserve red for critical statuses that may cause harm or require immediate action if not addressed (e.g., “Error” or “Failed”). This badge highlights urgency and alerts users to issues that need immediate handling.

## Behaviour
Badges are typically non-interactive; they’re usually used purely to display status or provide contextual information without direct interaction. However, there are exceptions in some cases where badges might include interactive behavior:

- If a status might be cryptical for some users, provide a tooltip to give a more clear description of it's meaning.
- If there's a logical action connected to a status so that clicking the badge you might perform an action to alter the status.

In general, though, <strong>badges should only be interactive if they serve a clear function</strong> beyond displaying information. If there’s any ambiguity, it’s often better to make them purely informational to avoid confusing users.
