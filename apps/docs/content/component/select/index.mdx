## Usage
The select component is designed for single-choice selections, offering native mobile functionality and enhanced accessibility. Best suited for simple option lists, while maintaining familiar dropdown behaviour across devices.

<Common title="Select vs. Dropdown" />

## Anatomy
The Select (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components. 
- **Header**: Label, Label support, contextual help, Extended support.
- **Body**: the actual field.
- **Footer**: error message.

Details of header and footer elements are described in <a href="/component/dropdown">dropdown</a>.

## Behaviour
Styling for the list off options varies by browser, and long text in the select component is truncated with ellipses.

## Examples of browser stylings
The option list will look and be handled according to each browser.
