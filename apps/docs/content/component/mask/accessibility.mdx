## Accessibility
All values we measure need to pass in order to give a check on the accessibility on all our components.

### Review
**Review button, webcomponent 2025-03-12 - PASSED**
- Contrast: Passed <br />Improves contrast of most content.
- Aria-label: Passed
- Keyboard Passed
- Darkmode: Passed <br />Low contrast on focus circle and background, but that is because of the settings of the other component, button.
- Focus: Passed <br />Can't see the focus circle at all, but that is because of the settings of the other component, button.
- Screen reader: Passed <br />

## Important considerations

### Content
To be used on images and with extra content. So if it pass the accessibility test or not depends on the content.

### Keyboard navigation
Uses default navigation: No extra navigation. It depends fully on what content that will be added.
