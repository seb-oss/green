## UX text

### Default breadcrumbs on desktop

- The breadcrumb should match the page's heading.
- If there is no heading, use the menu title.
- The last breadcrumb represents the current page.
- If the heading is very long and shortened in the menu title, use the menu title as the breadcrumb.

### Web page mobile
In mobile views, only the previous page's heading is displayed as the breadcrumb.

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
  <Figma node="4252-28407" caption="Desktop" />
  <Figma node="4252-28396" caption="Mobile" />
</Grid>

### The apps (native)
In our apps, we have the same pattern for breadcrumbs as for the mobile view. But, since each page typically features a navbar with a title there may not be enough space for a long text like the previous heading. In such cases, use "Back" instead. If there is no room for even the word "Back," display only the back arrow. Ensure that TalkBack/VoiceOver reads the previous page's title for accessibility.
