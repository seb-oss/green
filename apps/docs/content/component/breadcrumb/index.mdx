## Overview
We use breadcrumbs to display site hierarchy (rather than navigation path) and to increase findability of parent pages.

Breadcrumbs help users navigate upward in the hierarchy and typically help with back-movement also. They also help with context when navigation is otherwise out of sight (for example in a mobile view).

Breadcrumbs have been proven to reduce bounce rates for search-users, when they are able to quickly find related pages.

## When and how to use it
Use for sites/applications that have a substantial amount of pages present deeper down in site structures.

## Versions
<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
  <div>
    ### Desktop
    The full path may not take up more than one row in the layout.

</Grid>
<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
  <div>
    ### Truncated desktop
    If the path is too long the path is truncated after the root element

</Grid>
<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
  <div>
    ### Mobile or simple
    For mobile views we only display the link to the parent page, as the full path tends to take too much space.

    The same version may be used in shallow hierarchies where there still is a need to easily move one step up, or back to the page from where you came.
