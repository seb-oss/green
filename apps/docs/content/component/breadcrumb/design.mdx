## Design
Breadcrumbs are not a priority on the page, but still needs to be so prominent that they are noticed when needed. It follows the colour guidelines for links and plain text.

### Anatomy
Breadcrumbs are there as a visual and navigational aid. Links are divided with a slash sign. Current page is displayed in plain text.
