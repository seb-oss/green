## Accessibility
All values we measure need to pass in order to give a check on the accessibility on all our components.

### Review
**Review button, webcomponent 2025-03-12 - FAILED**
- Contrast: **Failed** <br />Hard to see what is selected because of low contrast and no checkmark or similar. Especially when only having 2 buttons. Often also is low contrast against the background (1.29:1).
- Aria-label: Passed
- Keyboard Passed
- Darkmode: Passed <br />Contrast better than lightmode, but still a fail (1.57:1).
- Focus: Passed
- Screen reader: Passed

## Important considerations

### Keyboard navigation
Uses default navigation: Tabs as normal and trigger on key-up with space and on key-down with enter.

### Selected
Should be at least 3 options. Else it can be hard to know which one is selected when there is no extra selected icon.

### Animation
Hopefully in future it will be possible to turn of the animation by a user setting.
