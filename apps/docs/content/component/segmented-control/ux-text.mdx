## Writing for segmented control
In general, there is not much room for vast labels in segmented controls. Keep the text of the controls concise and simple.

- Write short and to the point
- Make it clear what content the user can expect when clicking
- Only use upper case on the first word, or if it is a proper name or abbreviation
