## Accessibility
All values we measure need to pass in order to give a check on the accessibility on all our components.

### Review
**Review button, webcomponent 2025-03-14 - PASSED**
- Contrast: Passed
- Aria-label: Passed
- Keyboard Passed
- Darkmode: Passed
- Focus: Passed
- Screen reader: Passed

## Important considerations

### Keyboard navigation
Uses default navigation: Tabs as normal and change the selected option with the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right).

### Usage
For the web, the Radio and Radio Group components in Green Core are implemented to follow the radio and radiogroup
role specifications and closely mimic native `<input type="radio">`. If you follow all these do's and dont's all the
screen-readers should work well.

#### Do's and Dont's
- Always provide labels for both radios and group
- Always make sure each radio has a unique value
- Never use radio buttons outside of a radio group
- Never use less than two radios in a group
