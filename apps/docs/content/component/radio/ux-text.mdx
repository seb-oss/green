## Labels
The same writing principles apply to labels for input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, headings, page titles, navigation links, and other short texts.

### Use clear and informative words
Texts should be clear and to the point. Explain exactly what information is needed.

### Single words or full sentences
Keep texts as short as possible. Labels can be single words or full sentences. In some cases, questions work best to prompt users for the right details, such as:
- What type of property is it?
- How many adults will live in the new home?
- How do you earn your main income?

### Capitalisation rules
Headings and labels should not have every word capitalised. Use capital letters only for:
- The first letter of the first word
- Proper names
- Abbreviations

## Radio button options

### When the answer is yes and no
Match the radio button options to the label. If the label is a yes or no question, the options should be Yes and No – nothing else.
<Grid columns="2">
<Figma type="do" id="yes-no-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="yes-no-2" />
</Grid>

### Be consistent
Keep options consistent. Decide whether they should:
- Be full sentences and start with either a capital or lowercase letter
- End with a full stop or not
- Be a full sentence, a phrase, or a single word
<Grid columns="2">
<Figma type="do" id="consistancy-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="consistancy-2" />
</Grid>

## We ask the customers, they answer
Remember, the question is asked from our perspective, and the customer provides the answer. The label should be written in the “you” form, while the answer should be in the “I” form. However, this doesn’t mean you should always include I. Sometimes, it’s better to leave it out to avoid repetition and keep the text shorter.
<Grid columns="2">
<Figma type="do" id="talk-1-do" />
<Figma type="dont" id="talk-1-dont" />
<Figma type="do" id="talk-2-do" />
<Figma type="dont" id="talk-2-dont" />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
## Keep it simple
Plain text is crucial. Customers must easily understand both the words and the context. Make sure the options cover all possible choices and are clear so everyone can fill in the form. If other options might apply, include an Other option with a space for the customer to explain.
