The same text principles can be used for labels in input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, headings, page titles, navigation texts, link texts, and other short texts.

Use informative words <br />
The texts should be clear and informative. Avoid information-poor words such as information, important, welcome, and regarding.

Single words or complete sentences <br />
Keep the text as short as possible. Labels can be single words or full sentences. In some cases, questions are used to prompt the required information.

## Upper and lower case
Don’t start each word in headings and labels with upper case. Only use upper case in:
- The first letter of the first word
- The first letter of proper names
- Abbreviations

## Yes and no
Match the radio button options to the field label. If the label is a yes or no question, the only options should be “Yes” and “No".

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma type="do" id="yes-no-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="yes-no-2" />
</Grid>

## Be consistent
Write consistent options. Decide if they should
- be complete sentences and begin with lowercase or uppercase letters
- end with a full stop or not
- be a sentence, one, or a word

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma type="do" id="consistancy-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="consistancy-2" />
</Grid>

## The bank communicates with the customer
Remember, the bank asks the question, and the customer answers. The label should be in the “you” form, while the answer should be in the “I” form. However, the “I” form isn’t needed in all the answer, as it becomes redundant, and it's already clear that the user is responding.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma type="do" id="talk-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="talk-2" />
</Grid>

## Prevent redundancy
Keep the text to the point by excluding the I-form in some contexts.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma type="do" id="redundancy-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="redundancy-2" />
</Grid>



## Write in plain text and to the point
Plain texts are as important as always. The customers must understand both the words and the context. Make sure that the options cover all possible choices and are explicit so that all intended customers can fill in the form. If there could be other options, add the option Other and an input field where the customer can explain.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma type="do" id="plain-text-1" />
<Figma type="dont" id="plain-text-2" />
</Grid>
