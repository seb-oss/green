## Usage
Radio buttons are commonly used in forms, surveys, and settings where users need to make a single selection from a list of options. <br />
The benefit of using radio buttons over select is that users may easily scan the available options and make a quick selection.

## Anatomy 
The radio button (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components. 
- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: the actual radiobuttons.
- **Footer**: error message.

## Features 

<Grid columns="2">

### Label
All radio buttons need a label. The group needs a label too.

### Label support 
(Not available for contained variant) <br />
May be used for both the group label and for each individual radio button in the group.

</Grid>

### Contextual help
When  label and support text is not enough to explain a field we may use the info-icon. 

When clicked the extended support is displayed between the label support and the field.

If there is limited space use a tooltip. 
If there is large amounts of text use a modal.

</Grid>

### Error handling
If an error occurs we mark the entire group of options with error. The error is described with an error message.

<Figma id="error-contained" caption="Extended support visible" />
</Grid>


## Behaviour
- **Mutual exclusivity**: Only one radio button within a group can be selected at a time.
- **Defaults**: Aim for having one option pre-selected.

## Alignment
We can align the radio buttons both horizontal and vertical.
- **Horizontal**: works best with very few options, this also saves space.
- **Vertical**: works best if there's more than two options, easier to scan and select.

</div>
<div>
### Don't:
- Use radio buttons for non-mutually exclusive options; consider checkboxes instead.
- Overload users with too many radio buttons in a question. If you have to present a lot of options, use a select.
- Mix default and contained versions.
