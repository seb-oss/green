## Usage
Textarea is used for longer text inputs, featuring 4 default rows and possibility for automatic vertical resizing. Ideal for comments, descriptions, and other multiline content in forms and dialogs.

## Anatomy
The textarea (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components.
- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: The field with leading and trailing slots.
- **Footer**: Character counter and error message.

## Features

<div>
### Label
All input fields must have a label to ensure clarity and accessibility. Labels help users understand the purpose of the field, including those using assistive technologies.
</div>
<Figma id="label" caption="Textarea with a label." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">

### Optional field indicator
We only ask for required information. If some fields are optional, we let users know by adding "(optional)" in brackets next to the field label. The word "(optional)" is shown in regular font weight to distinguish it from the label.
</div>
<Figma id="optional-indicator" caption="Use '(optional)' to mark optional fields." />
</Grid>

<div>
### Support text
Use this to explain how to fill in the field, for example how to count or what to include. 
</div>
<Figma id="support-text" caption="Textarea  with support text." />
</Grid>

### Contextual help
If the label and support text arenâ€™t enough to explain a field, we can use the info icon.
Clicking the icon shows additional support text between the label support and the field.
- Use a tooltip if space is limited.
- Use a modal for large amounts of text.

### Leading icon
A leading icon visually reinforces the purpose of the field, helping users  to understand what type of information is needed.

### Clearable
To make it easy for users to clear a field, an x-icon button can be placed at the end of the field. This is commonly used in search/filter forms.
</div>
<Figma id="clearable" caption="Makes it easy to clear a field." />
</Grid>

### Error message
Used to indicate that a selection must be made from the dropdown or that there is an error with the selected option.
</div>
<Figma id="error" caption="Input field containing an error." />
</Grid>

### Character counter
For fields with a character limit, a counter can be added to show users how many characters they have left.

The counter starts with the maximum allowed characters. As the user types, the
remaining characters decrease. When the limit is nearly reached, the counter turns yellow. When or if the user exceeds the limit, the counter turns red.

If the user ignores this and attempts to submit, an error message will appear indicating that the maximum character limit has been reached.
<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="character-1" caption="Showing maximum characters." />
<Figma id="character-2" caption="Showing characters left." />
<Figma id="character-3" caption="Showing the number of characters over the limit." />
</Grid>


### Resize
The default Textarea has a fixed height based on the expected input.
This helps users understand how much text the field is intended for.
If the field should be resizable, there are two options:
- **Automatic**: Adjusts dynamically as the user types.
- **Manual**: Users can resize it by dragging the corner.
