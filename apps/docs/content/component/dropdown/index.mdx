### Optional field indicator
Not available for Floating label variant)
We always strive to only ask for mandatory information, so we want to inform users if some fields are optional. We do this by adding a parenthesis with the words "(optional)" next to the label with the field.

The text "(optional)" is set in font-weight regular, to differentiate from the label.

### Contextual help
When  label and support text is not enough to explain a field we may use the info-icon. 
When clicked the extended support is displayed between the label support and the field.
If there is limited space use a tooltip. 
If there is large amounts of text use a modal.

### Search
A search field may be used to filter the options. 
- If the list is long (e.g., 10+ items), searching helps users find what they need faster.
- When items are similar or not in a predictable order, searching improves efficiency.
- If users have a specific item in mind, typing is often faster than scrolling.
- Search helps users who navigate with keyboards or screen readers find options more quickly.

### Custom option layout
The text-slot for each dropdown and option may have a custom layout containing more than one value. Typically used for account selection.
These layouts may be customized for particular usage.
Note that these fields become higher than a regular dropdown.

### Combo box: You can select, but also type a new value. 
This type of field lets the user type in the field, just as an input field. By starting to type a list of options matching the entered text is displayed. If users enter an option that doesn't exist in the list, it's also accepted as a valid option.
