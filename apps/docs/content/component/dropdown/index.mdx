## Features

### Label
All dropdown fields need a label. Keep the label short. 
</div>
<Figma id="features-label" caption="Dropdown field with just a label" />
</Grid>

### Optional field indicator
(Not available for Floating label variant)
We always strive to only ask for mandatory information, so we want to inform users if some fields are optional. We do this by adding a parenthesis with the words "(optional)" next to the label with the field.

The text "(optional)" is set in font-weight regular, to differentiate from the label.

</div>
<Figma id="features-optional" caption="Use '(optional)' to mark optional fields." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Support text
Use this to explain how to fill the field. This may be an instruction of how to 
count or what to include. Limit the instructions to details that all or most users need.
</div>
<Figma id="features-support-text" caption="Dropdown field with support text." />
</Grid>

### Contextual help
When  label and support text is not enough to explain a field we may use the info-icon. 

When clicked the extended support is displayed between the label support and the field.

If there is limited space use a tooltip. 
If there is large amounts of text use a modal.

### Leading icon
A leading icon visually reinforces the purpose of the field, helping users  to understand what type of information is needed. 
</div>
<Figma id="features-leading" caption="Leading icon to distinguish the field" />
</Grid>

### Single select
Use this version when users may only select one option from the list.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="single-select-1" caption="Single select dropdown" />
<Figma id="single-select-2" caption="One option selected" />
</Grid>

### Multi select
Use this version when users may select one or multiple options from the list

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="multi-select-1" caption="Single select dropdown" />
<Figma id="multi-select-2" caption="Three options selected" />
</Grid>

### Search
A search field may be used to filter the options. 
- If the list is long (e.g., 10+ items), searching helps users find what they need faster.
- When items are similar or not in a predictable order, searching improves efficiency.
- If users have a specific item in mind, typing is often faster than scrolling.
- Search helps users who navigate with keyboards or screen readers find options more quickly.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="search-1" caption="Search in dropdown" />
<Figma id="search-2" caption="No options found in search" />
</Grid>

### Option groups
If the options can be grouped it may help the user find options from large lists.
The group may contain a badge indicating how many options the group holds.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="option-group-single" caption="Single select grouped" />
<Figma id="option-group-multi" caption="Multi select grouped" />
</Grid>

### Custom option layout
The text-slot for each dropdown and option may have a custom layout containing more than one value. Typically used for account selection.
These layouts may be customized for particular usage.
Note that these fields become higher than a regular dropdown.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="custom-1" caption="Custom dropdown option list" />
<Figma id="custom-2" caption="Custom dropdown selected." />
</Grid>

### Combo box
This type of field lets the user type in the field, just as an input field. By starting to type a list of options matching the entered text is displayed. If users enter an option that doesn't exist in the list, it's also accepted as a valid option.
</div>
<Figma id="combobox-1" caption="Dropdown list while typing." />
</Grid>

<div>
### Clearable
To make it easy for users to clear a field an x-icon button may be added at the end of the field. 
Often used in search/filter forms.
</div>
<Figma id="clearable" caption="Makes it easy to clear a search filter." />
