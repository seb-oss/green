## Accessibility
All values we measure need to pass in order to give a check on the accessibility on all our components.

### Review
**Review button, webcomponent 2025-03-05 - PASSED**
- Contrast: Passed
- Aria-label: Passed

## Important considerations

### Keyboard navigation
Uses default navigation: Tabs as normal and trigger on key-up with space and on key-down with enter and selecting options with arrow up and down.

### Animation
Hopefully in future it will be possible to turn of the animation by a user setting.
