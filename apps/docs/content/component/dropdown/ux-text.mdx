## Labels
The same text principles can be used for labels in input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, headings, page titles, navigation texts, link texts, and other short texts.

When selection components follow common standards for how they look and function, users know how to use them and how to submit their answers. Therefore, in dropdowns you don’t need to use words like Select or Choose to tell the user what to do.

### Use informative words
The texts should be clear and informative. Tell the user what information we are looking for. Avoid information-poor words such as information, important, welcome, and regarding.

### Single words or complete sentences
The texts should be as short as possible. Labels can be single words or complete sentences. In some situations, we use the question format to elicit the information that customers need to provide, such as What type of property is it? How many adults will live in the new home? How do you get your main income? and the like.

<Figma id="single-words" caption="Example of complete sentence" />
</Grid>

### Multiple selections
If users can select multiple options in a dropdown, this should be clearly indicated in the label or its description.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="multiple-selections" caption="Example of complete sentence" />
</Grid>

### Concise values
Dropdown options should be as brief and clear as possible.

### Placeholder
If a dropdown has no default option, the first value (which can’t be selected) should guide the user on what to choose, such as “Select”. In these cases, an error message is needed in case the user tries to continue without making a selection.

### Upper and lower case
Don’t start each word in headings and labels with upper case. Only use upper case in:
- The first letter of the first word
- The first letter of proper names
- Abbreviations
