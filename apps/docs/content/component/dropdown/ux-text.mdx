## Labels
The same writing principles apply to labels for input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, headings, page titles, navigation links, and other short texts.

When selection components follow common design standards, users understand how to use them and submit their choices. You donâ€™t need to add words like Select in dropdowns  they already know what to do.

### Use clear and informative words
Texts should be clear and to the point. Explain exactly what information is needed.

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Single words or full sentences
Keep texts as short as possible. Labels can be single words or full sentences. In some cases, questions work best to prompt users for the right details, such as:
- What type of property is it?
- How many adults will live in the new home?
- How do you earn your main income?
</div>
<Figma id="single-words" caption="Query format example (Eng)." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Multiple selections
If users can choose multiple options in a dropdown, clarify this in the label or description. Dropdown choices should be short and easy to understand.
</div>
<Figma id="multiple-selections" caption="Multiple selection example (Eng)." />
</Grid>

### Placeholder text
If a dropdown has no default option, the placeholder text should say Select.
<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="placeholder-eng" caption="Placeholder text example (Eng)." />
<Figma id="placeholder-swe" caption="Placeholder text example (Swe)." />
</Grid>
### Capitalisation rules
Headings and labels should not have every word capitalised. Use capital letters only for:
- The first letter of the first word
- Proper names
