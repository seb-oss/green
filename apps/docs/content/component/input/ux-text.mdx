## Input field default 
Our default input field has the label outside the field. This input field includes all the features we need in complex forms, and therefore it’s the most common.

### Labels
The same writing principles apply to labels for input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, headings, page titles, navigation links, and other short texts.

#### Single-word or complete sentence
The texts should be as short as possible. Labels can contain single-words, complete sentences or query format.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
    <Figma id="single-or-complete-1" caption="Single-word example (Eng)." />
    <Figma id="single-or-complete-2" caption="Single-word example (Swe)." />
    <Figma id="single-or-complete-3" caption="Complete sentence example (Eng)." />
    <Figma id="single-or-complete-4" caption="Complete sentence example (Swe)." />
    <Figma id="query-format-1" caption="Query format example (Eng)." />
    <Figma id="query-format-2" caption="Query format example (Swe)." />
</Grid>

#### Skip the verb in the label
You don’t need to use verbs such as Enter, Fill in, Write, or Choose in the label. For instance it’s shorter and easier to read Recipient’s name instead of Fill in the recipient’s name.

### Label support text

Use the label support text to explain the label more in detail. Use only if the label isn’t clear enough. Explain what the customer needs to know to fill in the field or understand the data displayed. Be brief.

</div>
<Figma id="label-support-text" caption="The label support text." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="1" gap="s">
<div>

### Placeholder text

Don’t use placeholder text. Since the placeholder text lies within the input field and disappears when the user starts entering text, it’s not very accessible. If the user needs information about how to fill in the field, use the label support text instead. 

</div> 
</Grid>


## Fixed text within the field
A general UX writing principle is to never hide important text or place it where it’s hard to read. It’s easier to read text in the label or label support text than text within the field. Therefore we avoid having fixed text in the field except when we ask for an amount, or if you use the floating label input. 

### Display the currency with a badge
An exception to the rule is when we ask the customer to fill in an amount, then we don’t include the currency in the label. Instead, a badge inside the input field could display the currency, e.g., kr, EUR. 

In most cases, we only ask for one currency per context, and users usually know which one it is. Therefore, a badge is enough to show the required currency. Remember that the abbreviated kr or EUR in the badge must be read as the full word, kronor or euro, by a screen reader.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
    <Figma id="no-kronor-eng" />
    <Figma id="no-kronor-swe" />
</Grid>

### Write the time period in the label
Don’t put time periods like month or year in a badge. Instead, add them to the label. This information is important for the user to be able to fill in the field correctly, and should not be hidden in a small badge.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
    <Figma id="time-period-do-eng" />
    <Figma id="time-period-do-swe" />
    <Figma id="time-period-dont-eng" />
    <Figma id="time-period-dont-swe" />
</Grid>

### Labels do’s and dont’s

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>

**Do**
- Use single words, complete sentences or the query format for the label. 
- If needed, use the label support text to explain the field. 
- The texts should be brief, clear, and informative. 
</div>
<div>
**Don't**
- Do not use verbs in the label. 
- Do not use placeholder text. 
- Do not use too many characters. 
</div>
</Grid>

### Error message
Provide a constructive suggestion on how to solve the problem by telling what the customer needs to adjust.

## Input field floating label

This variant of the input field, with the label inside the field and label support text below, should only be used when the label is a single word or kept in one line, such as <Inline>Email address</Inline> or <Inline>Personal identity number</Inline>. 

If an error occurs, the label support text will be replaced with the error message. Therefore, it’s important that the error message includes the label text and the information in the label support text.


<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<Figma height="260" id="floating-1" caption="Input field floating label, enabled and filled." />
<Figma height="260" id="floating-2" caption="Input field floating label, enabled and filled in error state." />
</Grid>

### Do’s and dont’s input field floating label

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>
<div>
**Do**
- Mobile number
</div>
<Figma type="do" id="floating-do-eng" />
<Figma type="do" id="floating-do-swe" />
</div>
<div>
<div>
**Don't**
- How much do you want to save each month?
</div>
<Figma type="dont" id="floating-dont-eng" />
<Figma type="dont" id="floating-dont-swe" />
</div>
</Grid>

## Default or floating label?

Since our forms mostly contain inputs with labels that need to be a sentence rather than only a single word, most contexts should use the regular input field. The label also often needs supporting text and this is much more user friendly in the default variant.

Before you choose think about this:

- Will there be any fields with longer labels? 
- Will my labels need the supporting text in some cases?

or

- Is my form only a short one with simple single word label inputs?
- Do the labels talk for themselves and don’t need the supporting text? If an error occurs, the label support text will be replaced with the error text.

**Remember – Don’t mix the two variants in the same context!**
