## Design
Forms are the cornerstone in most design systems. And our form fields are no different. Rounded corners to keep relations with checkboxes, radio buttons and buttons. The contained design version moves the support text within the form. This component is made to be prominent and clear, also with multiple form fields on a page. 

### Anatomy
Group label is always on top follow by optional support text. Each checkbox has a label and optional support text.
