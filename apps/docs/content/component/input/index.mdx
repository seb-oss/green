## Anatomy
The input (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components.
- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: The field with leading and trailing slots.
- **Footer**: Character counter, dynamic information and error message.

## Variants

To be able to use forms in all context's we provide two versions of input fields.
- **Default** 
- <Badge variant="notice">Coming soon</Badge> **Floating label** (label inside): Can only be used in specific contexts. Limited features due to accessibility.

<Grid columns="2">
    <Figma id="variant-default" caption="Default" />
    <Figma id="variant-floating-label" caption="Floating label" />
</Grid>


<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

## Sizes
The input field comes in two sizes.

- **Large**
- **Small**: used in tables and in some special cases where the space is very limited.

<Figma id="large-small-input" caption="Large and small input field." />
</Grid>

## Features

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Label
All input fields must have a label to ensure clarity and accessibility. Labels help users understand the purpose of the field, including those using assistive technologies.
</div>
<Figma id="label" caption="Large input field with a label." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Optional field indicator
We only ask for required information. If some fields are optional, we let users know by adding "(optional)" in brackets next to the field label. The word "(optional)" is shown in regular font weight to distinguish it from the label.
</div>
<Figma id="optional-field-indicator" caption="Use '(optional)' to mark optional fields." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Support text
Use this to explain how to fill in the field, for example how to count or what to include. 
</div>
<Figma id="support-text" caption="Label support text." />
</Grid>

### Contextual help
If the label and support text are not enough to explain a field, we can use the info icon.
Clicking the icon shows additional support text between the label support and the field.
- Use a tooltip if space is limited.
- Use a modal for large amounts of text.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="info-icon-button" height="250px" caption="Use the info icon to show more support text." />
<Figma id="extended-suppport" caption="Extended support expanded." />
</Grid>

### Leading icon
A leading icon visually reinforces the purpose of the field, helping users  to understand what type of information is needed. 
For example: search fields or card number.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma id="leading-search" caption="Leading icon to indicate it's a search field." />
<Figma id="leading-card-number" caption="Leading icon to indicate a card number." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Clearable
To make it easy for users to clear a field, an x-icon button can be placed at the end of the field. This is commonly used in search/filter forms.
</div>
<Figma id="clear-a-search-field" caption="Makes it easy to clear a field." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Badge
Use it to show what the unit input value is.

For example: EUR
</div>
<Figma id="currency-badge" caption="Badge used to display the currency EUR." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Error message
Used to indicate that a selection must be made from the dropdown or that there is an error with the selected option.
</div>
<Figma id="field-error" caption="Input field containing an error." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Character counter
For fields with a character limit, a counter can be added to show users how many characters they have left.

The counter starts with the maximum allowed characters. As the user types, the remaining characters decrease. When the limit is nearly reached, the counter turns yellow.
When or if the user exceeds the limit, the counter turns red.

If the user ignores this and attempts to submit, an error message will appear indicating that the maximum character limit has been reached.
</div>
<Figma id="character-counter" caption="Input field with the character counter." />
</Grid>

<div>
### Dynamic information
(Not available for Floating label variant)
Used to perform comparative calculations next to the field.

<Badge variant="notice" size="small">Coming soon</Badge>
</div>
<Figma id="dynamic-info" caption="Dynamic information displayed under the input field." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Static data
Used to display static data in a form or compilation. This approach is preferred over disabling fields, which can be problematic for accessibility.
</div>
<Figma id="static-data" caption="Example usage of static data." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Placeholder
Avoid using placeholder text (also known as watermark), as it can confuse users into thinking the field is already filled with data. Instructions should not be placed in the field, as they disappear once the user starts typing. Instead, use support text to guide users on what should be entered.
</div>
<Figma type="dont" id="placeholder" caption="Don't use placeholder text." />
</Grid>

## Do’s and dont’s

<Grid columns="2">
    <Figma type="do" id="do" caption="Do use '(optional)' to mark optional fields" />
    <Figma type="dont" id="dont" caption="Don't use asterix to indicate mandatory fields." />
</Grid>
