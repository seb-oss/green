## Overview 

### Usage
Input are used to let the user enter text or numbers in a form. 

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

### Variants
To be able to use forms in all context's we provide two versions of input fields.

- **Default** (Label outside): Includes all the features we need in complex forms.
- **Floating label**  (Label inside): gives a more clean look but doesn't work for longer labels and can only be used in specific contexts.

### Sizes
The input field comes in two sizes.

- **Large**: the default size and used in most cases.
- **Small**: used in tables and in some special cases where the space is very limited.

### Counter
For fields that have a limit of characters allowed a counter may be added to guide users into how many characters are left to use. Indicator starts with the maximum characters allowed displayed. As the user starts typing the numbers decrease. When a limit is reached the indicator turns yellow. If users write too many characters the counter becomes red. If a user ignores this and tries to submit an error will be indicated on the field stating that the max has been reached.

### Clearable
To make it easy for users to clear a field an x-icon may be added at the end of the field. If used, this icon is the first in the trailing slot close to the input it's removing when pressed.

### Placeholder
AVOID using placeholder text (also know as watermark). They tend to confuse users, thinking the field is already filled with data. Instructions should not be placed here, since they disappear as the field is filled with data. Use the support text instead to describe what's supposed to be entered.

### Input with button
Input fields can be grouped with a button. This is used if they have a very strong relationship inside a form. For example, fetching information from a database, signing up to a newsletter, etc. In a mobile viewport, the group is seen as one module and shares the width.

### Search field

The search field's work pretty much the same way as normal input fields, but we have some rules for icon-usage.
- Leading icon: used when the icon is only an ornament to signify that this is a search-field. 
- Trailing icon: used when the icon is also working as a button, users can click the icon to perform the search.
