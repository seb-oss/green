## Overview

### Variants
To be able to use forms in all context's we provide 2 versions of input fields.
<ul>
<li>Label outside (default): Includes all the features we need in complex forms.</li>
<li>Label inside: gives a more clean look but doesn't work for longer labels and can only be used in specific contexts.</li>
</ul>

### Sets
To be able to use forms in all context's we provide 2 versions of input fields.
<ul>
<li>Regular text field</li>
<li>Multi lined text field, Multiple lines. Some text fields require a lot more text to be entered. A simple example would be description of a payment. For this we use the multi-line version of the input-field. This is often known as a text area or free text. Counter. For some fields it's critical that users know the limitations. Counters start at the max and count down to zero. When the counter comes close to zero the appearance shifts to red to warn the user before the fields stops accepting input.</li>
