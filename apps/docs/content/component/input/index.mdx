The input (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components. 
- Header: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- Body: the actual field with leading and trailing slots.
- Footer; character counter, dynamic information and error message.


## Variants

To be able to use forms in all context's we provide two versions of input fields.
- **Default** (label outside): Includes all the features we need in complex forms.
- <Badge variant="notice">Coming soon</Badge> **Floating label** (label inside): Can only be used in specific contexts. Limited features due to accessibility.

## Sizes
The input field comes in two sizes.

- **Large**: the default size and used in most cases.
- **Small**: used in tables and in some special cases where the space is very limited.

## Features

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Label
All input fields need a label. Keep the label short. 
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Large input field with just a label." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Optional field indicator
(Not available for Floating label variant)
We always strive to only ask for mandatory information, so we want to inform users if some fields are optional. We do this by adding a parenthesis with the words "(optional)" next to the label with the field.

The text "(optional)" is set in font-weight regular, to differentiate from the label.
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Use '(optional)' to mark optional fields." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Support text
(Not available for Floating label variant)
Use this to explain how to fill the field. This may be an instruction of how to 
count or what to include. Limit the instructions to details that all or most users need.
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="" />
</Grid>

### Contextual help
(Not available for Floating label variant)
When  label and support text is not enough to explain a field we may use the info-icon. 

When clicked the extended support is displayed between the label support and the field.

If there is limited space use a tooltip. 
If there is large amounts of text use a modal.

<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Extended support visible" />
</Grid>

### Leading icon
A leading icon visually reinforces the purpose of the field, helping users  to understand what type of information is needed. 
For example: search fields or card number.

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Leading icon to indicate it's a search field." />
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Leading icon to indicate a card number." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Clearable
To make it easy for users to clear a field an x-icon button may be added at the end of the field. 
Often used in search/filter forms.
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Makes it easy to clear a search filter." />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<div>
### Badge
Use it to show what the unit input value is.

For example: kr
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Badge used to display the currency EUR." />
</Grid>

<div>
### Field error
When a field contains an error the field is highlighted in red with an error text describing the error.
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Input field containing an error." />
</Grid>

### Character counter
For fields that have a limit of characters allowed, a counter may be added to guide users how many characters are left to use. Indicator starts with the maximum characters allowed. 

As the user starts typing the numbers decrease. 

When a limit is almost reached the indicator turns yellow. 

If users write too many characters the counter becomes red. 

If a user ignores this and tries to submit an error will be indicated on the field stating that the max has been reached.

### Dynamic information
(Not available for Floating label variant)
Used to perform comparative calculations next to the field.
</div>

</Grid>

<div>
### Static data
Used to display static data in a form or compilation.
Can be used instead of disabling fields (which is bad for accessibility).

This is a separate component in Figma used to replace an input field.
</div>
<Figma node="606-10448" caption="Example usage of Static data." />
</Grid>

<div>
### Placeholder
AVOID using placeholder text (also know as watermark). They tend to confuse users, thinking the field is already filled with data. Instructions should not be placed here, since they disappear as the field is filled with data. Use the support text instead to describe what's supposed to be entered.
