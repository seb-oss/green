## UX text

## Yes and no
Adapt the radio button options to the field label. If the field label is a yes or no question, the answer options should be yes and no and nothing else.
<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
    <Do><Figma node="3140-10668"  /></Do>
    <Dont><Figma node="3140-10670"  /></Dont>
</Grid> 

## Be consistent
Write consistent options. Decide if they should
- be complete sentences and begin with lowercase or uppercase letters
- end with a full stop or not
- be a sentence, one, or a word

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
    <Do><Figma node="3140-27049" /></Do>
    <Dont><Figma node="3140-27051" /></Dont>
</Grid> 

## The bank talks to the customer
Remember, it is the bank that asks the question and the customer who answers. Therefore, the label should be in the you-form and the answer in the I-form. However, most of the time, the answer does not include the I-form because that becomes redundant, you understand that it is the user who answers.

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
    <Do><Figma node="3140-27998" /></Do>
    <Dont><Figma node="3140-28000" /></Dont>
</Grid> 

## Prevent redundancy
Keep the text to the point by excluding the I-form in some contexts.

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
    <Do><Figma node="3140-28461" /></Do>
    <Dont><Figma node="3140-28463" /></Dont>
</Grid>

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
    <div>
        ## Write in plain text and to the point
        Plain texts are as important as always. The customers must understand both the words and the context. Make sure that the options cover all possible choices and are explicit so that all intended customers can fill in the form. If there could be other options, add the option Other and an input field where the customer can explain.
