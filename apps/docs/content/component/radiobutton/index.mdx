## Overview
Radio buttons are used when users need to select one option from a set of mutually exclusive choices. They are commonly used in forms, surveys, and settings where users need to make a single selection from a list of options.

The benefit of using radio buttons over select is that users may easily scan the available options and make a quick selection.

## Variants
- **Default:** used in most cases.
- **Contained:** used only in combination with other contained form components.
- **Contained extended:** The contained version but including Label support text.

## Features

        ### Label support
        May be used for both the group label, and for each individual radio button in the group.
        Try to be consistent if using them on the individual buttons.

</Grid>


## Behaviour
- **Mutual Exclusivity:** Only one radio button within a group can be selected at a time.
- **Defaults:** Aim for having one option pre-selected.



## Alignment
We can align the radio buttons both horizontal and vertical.
- **Horizontal:** works best with very few options, this also saves space.
- **Vertical:** works best if there's more than two options, easier to scan and select.


## Do's and Don'ts

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">
<div>
### Do:
- Use descriptive labels to clearly indicate the purpose of each radio button.
- Keep the text as short as possible.
- There needs to be at least two options.
- Try to sort the options in a logical order.
</div>
### Don't:
- Use radio buttons for non-mutually exclusive options; consider checkboxes instead.
- Overload users with too many radio buttons in a question. If you have to present a lot of options, use a select.
- Mix default and contained versions.
