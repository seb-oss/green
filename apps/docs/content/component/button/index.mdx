A button serve as an interactive element that enables users to perform an action or make a choice with a simple click or tap. To decide which kind of button/buttons and putting them in the right order is key to make sure users know how to take the right action. A good rule of thumb is to use only one primary action in each context.

## Buttons

We have a group of different buttons used for specific purposes.

<Grid columns="1; s{2} m{3}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="default-button" caption="Default button" />
  <Figma id="icon-button" caption="Icon button" />
  <Figma id="fab-button" caption="Floating action button" />
  <Figma id="split-button" caption="Split button" />
  <Figma id="next-back-button" caption="Next and back button" />
</Grid>

### Default button

The default button is our most used button. It comes in primary, secondary and tertiary, and the sizes small, medium and large.

The default button can be used as the positive, negative and inverted type. 
<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="default-prio" caption="Primary, secondary and tertiary" />
  <Figma id="default-pos-neg" caption="Positive and negative" />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

### Icon button

When there is space, the icon button should always be grouped with a text label. This text provides additional context for users who may not understand the icon alone. If space is not available the icon need to be self explanatory, and have a tooltip function explaining the action.

The icon button comes in primary, secondary, and tertiary. In the sizes small, medium, and large. The icon button also comes as a tonal in two sets. One tonal in grey, used mostly on our container colour. And a few custom tonal combinations, used on custom combination cards. For example our alert ribbons.

The icon button can be used as the positive, negative and inverted type also when the context needs it. 

<Grid columns="1; s{2} m{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="icon-button" caption="Icon button – default and positive" />
  <Figma id="icon-button-custom" caption="Tonal and custom tonal" />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

### Floating action button

Only used for functions central to the user experience, such as support and help features that needs to be accessible at all times.

The button is always floating visible in the users viewport, typically in the lower right corner. This button can be used with an icon only.

Used only as primary.
 
<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="fab" caption="Floating action button" />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

### Split button

The split button always has a primary action. This action is most likely to be used by the customer as the default action.When users click on the primary action, it triggers this action directly, such as submitting a form, confirming a selection, or initiating a process.

The users can click on the dropdown arrow to reveal a dropdown menu providing secondary or additional options.

The split button comes in both primary and secondary.

<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="split-1" caption="Split button – primary and secondary" />
  <Figma id="split-2" caption="Split button – active with dropdown" />
</Grid>

### Next and back button

Used inside flows to signal the direction forward or backward.

Back button comes in both primary and secondary state depending on what suits the content. The next button comes as primary only.
<Grid columns="1; s{2} m{3}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="next" caption="Next button" />
  <Figma id="back-1" caption="Back button – primary" />
  <Figma id="back-2" caption="Back button – secondary" />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

## Variants

- **Default**: The preferred choice of button in most contexts.
- **Positive**: To be decided.
- **Negative**: Use for the actions that may be harmful or destructive. A good example is deleting
- **Tonal**: Only used internal in other components (to match a background).
- **Inverted**: Used to place on other than the normal backgrounds (typically darker tones).

## Hierarchy

It's critical to find the right balance of what buttons to use. It's up to us as designers to guide and inform the users to take the right action.

- **Primary buttons** require the most attention from your users.
- **Secondary buttons**, as the name says, is the second most likely choice.
- **Tertiary buttons** are used for less used or unwanted actions that is still relevant to find.

  <Figma id="hierarchy" caption="From the top – primary, secondary, tertiary" />
</Grid>

## Button sizes

The default button and icon button comes in a few different sizes. 32, 40 and 48 px. 

<Grid columns="1; s{2} m{3}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="small" caption="Small – used in confined spaces, like tables." />
  <Figma id="medium" caption="Medium – the default size. When in doubt, go for medium." />
  <Figma id="large" caption="Large – only used in large areas like a hero." />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

## Placements, right, left or stacked?

A general rule is to always strive to place buttons in connection to the items they control. 

### Desktop placements

- **Left:** In overviews and widgets, the user tends to read from top to bottom, therefore the buttons are kept to the left.
- **Right:** Modals and flows move the user from left to right, therefore the buttons are placed to the right. 

<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="placement-desktop-1" caption="Placement left" />
  <Figma id="placement-desktop-2" caption="Placement right" />
</Grid>

### In a mobile device

- **One button**, use the full width of the content area.
- **Two buttons**, aim to place them side by side. It is allowed to stack them if needed.
- **Three buttons**, consider the need for all of them. "cancel or close" might be x in the top right corner. Worst case scenario: place  two buttons side by side and one tertiary button under.

<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
  <Figma id="placement-mobile-1" caption="One button in mobile" />
  <Figma id="placement-mobile-2" caption="Side by side in mobile" />
</Grid>

## Do’s and don’ts
Only use one primary action in the same context of several actions.

<Grid columns="1; s{2}" gap="s">
    <Figma type="do" id="do" />
    <Figma type="dont" id="dont" />
</Grid>
