## Overview
A button serve as an interactive element that enables users to perform an action or make a choice with a simple click or tap. It's important to decide what type of button and what em in order to give the user action highest prioritised. A good rule of thumb is to use only one primary action in each context.

### Hierarchy
It's critical to find the right balance of what buttons to use. It's up to us as designers to guide and inform the users to take the right action.

<ul>
    <li>Primary buttons require the most attention from your users.</li>
    <li>Secondary buttons, as the name says, is the second most likely choice.</li>
    <li>Tertiary buttons are used for less used or unwanted actions that is still relevant to find.</li>
</ul>

</Col>
</Row>

### Types
<ul>
<li>Normal: The normal button!</li>
<li>Negative: Use for the actions that may be harmful/destructive. A good example is deleting.</li>
<li>Positive: Use this for buying stocks/funds etc. Transaction-action.</li>
<li>Inverted: Used to place on other than the normal backgrounds (typically darker tones)</li>
<li>Tonal: Only used internal in other components</li>
</ul>

Used for very simple actions, because most people will not understand buttons that don't have a label connected. They are often tightly grouped with other components to create context for the buttons purpose.

The Icon button comes in Primary, Secondary, Tertiary.  In the sizes Small, Medium, Large. The Icon button also comes as tonal in two sets. One Tonal in grey, used mostly on our Container color. And a few custom tonal combinations, used on custom combination cards. Example our Alert ribbons.

## Placements
A general rule is to always strive to place buttons in connection to the items they control. Modals and flows move the user from left to right, therefore the buttons are placed to the right. In overviews and widgets, the user tends to read from top to bottom, therefore the buttons are kept to the left.

<Row>
<Col>
### Left
<ul>
    <li>Place the affirmative/primary button on the left, and the dismissive/secondary button on the right</li>
    <li>Used on basic/overview pages, widgets or when content is mostly on the left side of the page</li>
</ul>
</Col>
<Col><Image src="/content/button/image-light.png" dark="/content/button/image-dark.png" alt="test"  /></Col>
</Row>

<Row>
<Col>
### Right
<ul>
    <li>Place the affirmative/primary button on the right, the dismissive/secondary button on the left.</li>
    <li>Used for modals (dialog, slide-out, take-over) and flows (such as wizards)</li>
</ul>
</Col>
<Col><Image src="/content/button/image-light.png" dark="/content/button/image-dark.png" alt="test" /></Col>
</Row>

<Row>
<Col>
### In mobile devices
<ul>
    <li>If one button, use the full width of the screen (with margins).</li>
    <li>If two buttons, aim to place them side by side, with 1 rem between them. It is allowed to stack them if needed.</li>
    <li>If three buttons, consider the need for all of them. "Cancel/close" might be x in the top right corner. Worst case scenario: place the two buttons side by and one link button under.</li>
</ul>
