## UX text

The button text should answer the question "What is happening?" when the user clicks it, but if the purpose of the button is to convert, it should answer the question "What do I get?".

### Use commands and requests in the button

You should primarily use verbs in the imperative mood, which is the form of the verb 
that conveys commands or requests, for example, *Order, Apply, Submit and Sign.* 
If needed, you can add what happens, for example, *Write a new message* or *Add a row*. 
In special cases, the button may consist of another type of text, for example, *This solution suits me.*

### Avoid Perform and Okay

Avoid using words like *Perform <Inline lang="se">(Utför)</Inline> and Okay <Inline lang="se">(Okej)</Inline>* in buttons. 
Perform is too formal and Okay is too vague and doesn’t answer the question “What is happening?” when the user clicks the button.

### Standard button texts

Standard text for our most commonly used buttons.

<Grid columns="3">
<Figma id="standard-next" caption="Next (Nästa)" />
<Figma id="standard-back" caption="Back (Tillbaka)" />
<Figma id="standard-cancel" caption="Cancel (Avbryt)" />
<Figma id="standard-delete" caption="Delete (Ta bort)" />
<Figma id="standard-change" caption="Change (Ändra) – takes the user to edit mode." />
<Figma id="standard-save" caption="Save (Spara)" />
<Figma id="standard-close" caption="Close (Stäng) – closing a dialog, modal, slide-out etc." />
<Figma id="standard-sign" caption="Sign (Signera) – signing with BankID." />
<Figma id="standard-identify" caption="Identify yourself (Identifiera dig) – identifying with BankID." />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

<Grid columns="2">

<div>
## Cancel and close

It is important to avoid confusion for the user which button to click. The combination *Cancel* and *Close* is very similar. Instead, use *Back* as the secondary action when primary action is *Cancel*.
</div>

<Figma id="cancel-close" caption="This is a good example of avoiding confusion for the customer." />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

## Do’s and don’ts

<Grid columns="2">

<div>
**Do**

- Answer the question “What is happening?” or “What do I get?”.
- Use commands or requests in the button.
- Use *Back* as secondary action in modals where primary actions is *Cancel*.
</div>

<div>
**Don’t**

- Avoid the formal *Perform <Inline lang="se">(Utför)</Inline>* and the vague *Okay <Inline lang="se">(Okej)</Inline>*.
- Do not use primary and secondary button text that is too similar to each other.
</div>

</Grid>

<Grid columns="2">
<Figma type="do" id="ux-do" />
<Figma type="dont" id="ux-dont" />
</Grid>
