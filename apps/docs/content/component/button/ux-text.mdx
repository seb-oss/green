## UX text

The button text should answer the question "What is happening?" when the user clicks it, but if the purpose of the button is to convert, it should answer the question "What do I get?".

### Use commands and requests in the button

You should primarily use verbs in the imperative mood, which is the form of the verb 
that conveys commands or requests, for example, *Order, Apply, Submit and Sign.* 
If needed, you can add what happens, for example, *Write a new message* or *Add a row*. 
In special cases, the button may consist of another type of text, for example, *This solution suits me.*

### Avoid Perform and Okay

Avoid using words like *Perform <SE>(Utför)</SE> and Okay <SE>(Okej)</SE>* in buttons. 
Perform is too formal and Okay is too vague and doesn’t answer the question “What is happening?” when the user clicks the button.

### Standard button texts

Standard text for our most commonly used buttons.

## Cancel and close

It is important to avoid confusion for the user which button to click. The combination *Cancel* and *Close* is very similar. Instead, use *Back* as the secondary action when primary action is *Cancel*.
