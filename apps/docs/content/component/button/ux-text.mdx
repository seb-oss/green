## UX Text
The button text should answer the question "What is happening?" when the user clicks it, but if the purpose of the button is to convert, it should answer the question "What do I get?".

### Use verbs in the imperative mood
You should primarily use verbs in the imperative mood, which is the form of the verb that conveys commands or requests, for example, <em>Order, Apply, Submit and Sign</em>. If needed, you can add what happens, for example, <em>Write a new message</em> or Add a row. In special cases, the button may consist of another type of text, for example, <em>This solution suits me</em>.

### Avoid the formal Perform and the vague Okay
Avoid using words like <em>Perform <SE>(Utför)</SE> and Okay <SE>(Okej)</SE></em> in buttons. Perform is too formal and Okay is too vague and doesn’t answer the question “What is happening?” when the user clicks the button.

### Standard button texts
Standard text for our most commonly used buttons.

<Row>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8563" caption="Next/Nästa – Takes the user to the next step in a flow." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8541" caption="Back/Tillbaka – Takes the user to the previous step in a flow or aborts the action in dialog and slide outs (used when Cancel or something similar is the primary action)." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8782" caption="Cancel/Avbryt – Cancels the action." /></Col>
</Row>
<Row>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8544" caption="Delete/Ta bort – The user wants to delete something (often in red text and with an illustration of a trash can)." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8548" caption="Change/Ändra – The user wants to change something." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8551" caption="Save/Spara – The user wants to save something, for instance, a change." /></Col>
</Row>
<Row>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8557" caption="Close/Stäng – To close a dialog, modal, slide out etc." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8554" caption="Sign/Signera – The user is signing with BankID." /></Col>
<Col><FigmaSVG node="1612-8560" caption="Identify yourself/Identifiera dig – The user is identifying themselves with BankID" /></Col>
</Row>

## Good example
It is important to avoid confusion for the user which button to click. The combination Cancel and Close is very similar. Instead, use Back as the secondary action when primary action is Cancel.

<Col>
    <FigmaSVG 
        node="1642-1513" 
        caption="This is a good example of avoiding confusion for the customer." 
    />
