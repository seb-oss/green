## Design

Each button type has fully rounded corners. This creates a cohesive and consistent visual language within our design system. The differentiation in colour, border, and background helps users to easily distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary actions, contributing to a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

<Figma node="258-2977" caption="A primary button has a solid container." />
<Figma node="258-2986" caption="A secondary button has a transparent container and 1 px border." />

## Anatomy

A button consists of a container, a text, and an optional leading or trailing element (icon). The anatomy of a button in our design system includes various visual and functional elements that work together to create a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Here is a breakdown of the key components:
</div>


<Figma node="258-3056" caption="Container, text, leading and trailing element." />
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

<Grid columns="1; s{2} m{3}">
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-6654" caption="Text" />

        *Purpose*

        Displays the primary action or information associated with the button.

        *Attributes*

        Font size, colour, and style are essential for readability and visual hierarchy.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-6656" caption="Container" />

        *Purpose*

        Forms the overall shape of the button and contains its elements.

        *Attributes*

        Background colour or style, border-radius and dimensions.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-6658" caption="Border" />

        *Purpose*

        Defines the outer edge of the button, providing a visual separation from the surrounding elements.

        *Attributes*

        Thickness, colour, and style.
    </div> 
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-7238" caption="Leading element" />
        
        *Purpose*

        Provides additional context or visual cues to users before they interact with the button.

        *Attributes*

        Size, colour, and alignment within the button.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-7241" caption="Trailing element" />

        *Purpose*

        Serves a similar purpose to a leading element but is positioned on the right side of the button.

        *Attributes*

        Size, colour, and alignment within the button.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-7245" caption="Spacing/Padding" />

        *Purpose*

        Determines the distance between the button's content (text, icon) and its container's edges.

        *Attributes*

        Ensure adequate padding for touch targets and visual balance.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-7314" caption="State indicators" />

        *Purpose*

        Communicate the button's current state (e.g. hovered, pressed).

        *Attributes*

        Colour changes, subtle animations, or other visual cues.
    </div>
    <div>
        <Figma node="264-7319" caption="Accessibility features" />

        *Purpose*

        Ensures the button is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.

        *Attributes*

        ARIA attributes, focus styles, and sufficient colour contrast.
    </div>
</Grid>

<GdsDivider size="4xl" opacity="0.2" />

## Leading and trailing elements

An icon positioned at the beginning is known as a leading element, the one at the end of the text is referred to as a trailing element. Both types of elements share common purposes, offering visual cues and improving the user interface. 

<Grid columns="1; s{2}">
<div>
### Leading element

Use leading elements to support the button text. 
Some examples could be a trash can icon + text *Delete*, 
a search icon + text *Search* and arrow to bottom icon + text *Download*. 
</div>

<Figma node="266-7387" caption="Leading elements that support the button text." />
</Grid>

<br size="xl" />

<Grid columns="1; s{2}">
<div>
### Trailing element

Use trailing element as an affordance of what will happen when you interact with the button. For example, a button that leads the user forward in a flow, an arrow icon is a good choice.
</div>
<Figma node="266-7448" caption="The trailing element gives a hint on what is about to happen on click." />
</Grid>
