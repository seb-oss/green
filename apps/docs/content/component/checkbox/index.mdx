## Usage
Checkboxes are commonly used in forms, settings, and filters to allow users to indicate their preferences. <br/>
The checkboxes are typically grouped with a theme label above and the possible options below.

## Anatomy
The checkbox (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components. 
- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: the actual checkboxes.
- **Footer**: only used for error message.

4. Extended support text

6. Checkbox support text


## Variants
- **Default**
- **Contained**: used standalone or in combination with other contained form components.

## Features

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>
### Label

All individual checkboxes have a label. <br />
When checkboxes are grouped, the group have a header label.

</div>
<Figma id="label" caption="Group and individual label" />
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>
### Optional field indicator
Used only for the header label. <br />
We always strive to only ask for mandatory information, so we want to inform users if some fields are optional. We do this by adding a parenthesis with the words "(optional)" next to the label with the field.

The text "(optional)" is set in font-weight regular, to differentiate from the label.

</div>
<Figma id="optional" caption="Use '(optional)' to mark optional fields." />
</Grid>

### Support text
May be used on both header and individual checkbox. <br />
Contained checkboxes do not have support text for the individual checkboxes.<br />
Use this to explain how to use the field. This may be an instruction of how to 
count or what to include. Limit the instructions to details that all or most users need.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
  <Figma id="support-text-1" caption="Default checkboxes with support text." />
  <Figma id="support-text-2" caption="Contained checkboxes with support text." />
</Grid>

### Contextual help
When  label and support text is not enough to explain a field we may use the info-icon. 

When clicked the extended support is displayed between the label support and the field.

If there is limited space use a tooltip. <br />
If there is large amounts of text use a modal.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
  <Figma id="contextual-1" caption="Info icon button to reach help." />
  <Figma id="contextual-2" caption="Extended support visible." />
</Grid>

### Error handling
Used to highlight that a single checkbox needs to be checked, or that a group of checkboxes contains errors.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
  <Figma id="error-1" caption="Default checkboxes with error." />
  <Figma id="error-2" caption="Contained checkbox with error." />
</Grid>

### Indeterminate state
(Not available for contained variant) <br />
Used when the checkbox state is partially selected, often for parent-child relationships in nested checkboxes.

Behaviour
- If some children are selected, the indeterminate state is visible on the parent.
- If all children are selected, the selected state is visual on the parent.
- If a parent checkbox is selected while unselected or in the indeterminate state, all children will be selected.
- If the parent is deselected all children will be deselected.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
  <Figma id="indeterminate-1" caption="Checkbox with children." />
  <Figma id="indeterminate-2" caption="The checkbox 'All' showing the indeterminate state." />
  <Figma id="indeterminate-3" caption="All children selected." />
</Grid>

## Alignment
Checkboxes can be aligned horizontal or vertical.
- **Vertical**: This is the default alignment. It's easier to read and scan the available options.
- **Horizontal**: Only used for a small set of options if the page shouldn't be to long, but try to avoid.

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
  <Figma id="alignment-vertical-1" caption="Default checkboxes with vertical alignment." />
  <Figma id="alignment-horisontal-1" caption="Default checkboxes with horizontal alignment." />
  <Figma id="alignment-vertical-2" caption="Contained checkboxes with vertical alignment." />
  <Figma id="alignment-horisontal-2" caption="Contained checkboxes with horizontal alignment." />
</Grid>

## Do's and don'ts

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>
### Do
- Use descriptive labels to clearly indicate the purpose of each checkbox.
- Keep the text as short as possible.
</div>
<div>
### Don't
- Use checkboxes for mutually exclusive options; in such cases, use radio buttons instead.
- Overload users with too many checkboxes on a single page or form. If you have to present a lot of options, use a multiselect dropdown.
- Use it to toggle things on or off, use the switch component for that.
Mix default and contained versions.
