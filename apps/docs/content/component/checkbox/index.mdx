Checkboxes are commonly used in forms, settings, and filters to allow users to indicate their preferences.
The checkboxes are typically grouped with a theme label above and the possible options below.

## Anatomy
The checkbox (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components. 
- Header: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- Body: the actual checkboxes.
- Footer; only used for error message.

### Indeterminate state

Used when the checkbox's state is partially selected, often for parent-child relationships in nested checkboxes.

**Behaviour of indeterminate checkboxes**
- If some children are selected, the indeterminate state is visible on the parent.
- If all children are selected, the selected state is visual on the parent.
- If a parent checkbox is selected while unselected or in the indeterminate state, all children will be selected.
- If the parent is deselected all children will be deselected.`

## Alignment
Checkboxes can be aligned horizontal or vertical.

- **Vertical:** This is the default alignment. It's easier to read and scan the available options
- **Horizontal:** Only used for a small set of options if the page shouldn't be to long, but try to avoid.

## Do's and Don'ts

<Grid columns="2" gap="s">
<div>
  ### Do:
    - Use descriptive labels to clearly indicate the purpose of each checkbox.
    - Keep the text as short as possible.
</div>
<div>
  ### Don't:
    - Use checkboxes for mutually exclusive options; in such cases, consider using radio buttons instead.
    - Overload users with too many checkboxes on a single page or form. If you have to present a lot of options, use a multiselect dropdown.
    - Use it to toggle things on or off, use the switch for that.
    - Mix default and contained versions.
