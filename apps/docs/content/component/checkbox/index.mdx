## Overview

Checkboxes are used when users need to select one or multiple options from a list of choices. They are commonly employed in forms, settings, and filters to allow users to indicate their preferences.
Checkboxes are typically grouped with a theme label above and the possible options below.


## Variants
	- **Default:** used in most cases.
	- **Contained:** used only in combination with other contained form components.

    ### Indeterminate state
    
    Used when the checkbox's state is partially selected, often for parent-child relationships in nested checkboxes.
    
    **Behaviour of indeterminate checkboxes**
    - If some children are selected, the indeterminate state is visible on the parent.
    - If all children are selected, the selected state is visual on the parent.
    - If a parent checkbox is selected while unselected or in the indeterminate state, all children will be selected.
    - If the parent is deselected all children will be deselected.

</Grid>






## Alignment
Checkboxes can be aligned horizontal or vertical.

- **Vertical:** This is the default alignment. It's easier to read and scan the available options
- **Horizontal:** Only used for a small set of options if the page shouldn't be to long, but try to avoid.

## Do's and Don'ts

<Grid columns={2} gapInline="small">

  ### Do:
    - Use descriptive labels to clearly indicate the purpose of each checkbox.
    - Keep the text as short as possible.
</div>
<div>
  ### Don't:
    - Use checkboxes for mutually exclusive options; in such cases, consider using radio buttons instead.
    - Overload users with too many checkboxes on a single page or form. If you have to present a lot of options, use a multiselect dropdown.
    - Use it to toggle things on or off, use the switch for that.
    - Mix default and contained versions.
