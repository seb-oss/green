## UX text

Write checkbox labels so that the customers can easily understand what it means to check the box or leave it blank. It can be difficult when customers must check an individual stand-alone checkbox, for example, that they accept the terms or want to receive news and offers by e-mail. Or when they should be able to turn a setting on or off and it is essential that they actively take a stand on the choice. (If there is a default option that almost everyone will choose, use a toggle instead.)

The label and options must also be adapted to suit each other. If the field label is a yes or no question, the answer options should be yes and no and nothing else. Since the user can only choose one of these options, use radio buttons instead.

Furthermore, remember to write consistent options. Decide if the options should

- consist of complete sentences beginning with uppercase and ending with a full stop
- constitute one continuing sentence beginning with lowercase and only the last point ending with a full stop

**or**

- a single word or a couple of words and no full stop.

## Negations
### Avoid negations and use the I-form
Avoid negations such as Do not send me more e-mails in the checkbox label, as this would mean that users have to check the box to prevent something from happening. Also, do not use questions like Do you want newsletters from us? The convention is to use the I-form for this type of checkbox.

## Accepting the terms
### When the user accepts terms, use I-form and avoid a question

    - <SE>Jag har läst informationen och granskat de uppgifter jag fyllt i. Jag försäkrar att de är riktiga.</SE>
    - I have read the information and reviewed what I entered in the form. I ensure that everything is correct.

## Multiple options
Decide if the options should consist of complete sentences beginning with uppercase and ending with a full stop, constitute one continuing sentence beginning with lowercase and only the last point ending with a full stop or a single word or a couple of words and no full stop. Provide clear instructions that the user can select multiple options. The label and options must also be adapted to suit each other. If the field label is a yes or no question, the answer options should be yes and no and nothing else.
