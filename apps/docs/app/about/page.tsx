              Green Design System is a set of standards to manage design at

              By using pre-built components for design tools and front-end
              frameworks the time teams spend designing and building is
              minimized. Instead of spending time on building and re-building
              the same components in multiple teams, teams can spend that time
              on addressing specific user needs to improve user experience.
