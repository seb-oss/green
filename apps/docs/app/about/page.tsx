                Green Design System is a set of standards to manage design at
                scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language
                and visual consistency across different pages and channels.

                designers and developers should use the Green Design System.

                By using pre-built components for design tools and front-end
                frameworks the time teams spend designing and building is
                minimized. Instead of spending time on building and re-building
                the same components in multiple teams, teams can spend that time
                on addressing specific user needs to improve user experience.
