                <h1>UX writing and our guidelines</h1>
                <p>
                  Regardless of where, when or how the customer meets us, the
                  experience of SEB must be the same because each meeting
                  contributes to how we are perceived. A positive customer
                  experience opens the door to new business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is particularly important in texts aimed at customers.
                  Mistakes affect the reader&apos;s concentration on the content
                  and understanding of the text. Because our texts are correct,
                  our credibility with customers and other visitors (=potential
                  customers) increases.

                <h2 id="written-id">Written ID – our tone of voice</h2>
                <p>
                  SEB&apos;s Written ID is our guiding light, and it forms the
                  basis for all our communication, including UX writing. Our
                  communication must show that we live and operate according to
                  our language keys:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Open and personal:</strong> We are people speaking
                    to people. That’s why we prefer using an informal, personal
                    voice rather than an official one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Relevant and clear:</strong> Our texts are clear and
                    easy to grasp, and we start with what’s most important.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Driven and engaged:</strong> We have the engagement
                    and energy; we share our drive with our customers.
                    Linguistically that means our language is alert and modern.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The voice the customers encounter when they use a service on
                  the internet banking services or the mobile apps must be the
                  same in guides, sales, error messages, etc. But UX writing
                  should, to a greater degree than other non-fiction texts, be
                  consistent. Therefore, we have special principles for
                  different design components.
                </p>
                <h2>UX writing in SEB</h2>
                <h3>
                  What is UX writing and how will good UX texts help our
                  customers?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The UX texts help the user, or customer, to navigate apps,
                  websites, and other digital products. They are one part of
                  many in a final design. UX texts focus on accessibility, they
                  are short and to the point without losing any important
                  information. They are user-friendly, contextually appropriate
                  and with the right tone of voice. The UX texts should solve a
                  user problem and meet the business goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These are many requirements to take into account and which do
                  not always go hand in hand with each other. Therefore, people
                  with the right knowledge and skills must write the UX texts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Good UX writing is like a personal guide that acts in the
                  background and helps customers understand how to act and
                  navigate. It ensures that customers do not end up in
                  situations where they feel stupid or underestimated. Really
                  good UX writing will rather make them feel satisfied because
                  they succeed in finishing a task without unnecessary
                  thresholds.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Consistent – we strive to use the same word for the same
                    item, action, or object.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Educational – we make an effort to be brief and pedagogic.
                  </li>
                  <li>Distinct – we avoid bank or tech jargon.</li>

                <p>
                  If you need to translate Swedish texts into English, the bank
                  has agreements with, among others, Språkkonsulterna and
                  Lionbridge. Contact them directly to order a translation.
                </p>

                  When you contact them to ask if they are available to take on
                  the assignment, they want to know approximately how many words
                  are to be translated. They also need to know the name of who
                  will pay the invoice before you send the translation document.
                </p>
                <ul>
