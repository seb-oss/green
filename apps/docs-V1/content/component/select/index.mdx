## Usage
The select component is designed for single-choice selections, offering native mobile functionality and enhanced accessibility. Best suited for simple option lists, while maintaining familiar dropdown behaviour across devices.

<Common title="Select vs. dropdown" />

## Anatomy
The select (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components.

- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: The field.
- **Footer**: Error message.

Details of header and footer elements are described in <a href="/component/dropdown">dropdown</a>.

## Behaviour
Styling for the list of options varies by browser, and long text in the select component is truncated with ellipses.

## Examples of browser stylings
The option list will look and be handled according to each browser.
