## Usage
Radio buttons are commonly used in forms, surveys, and settings where users need to make a single selection from a list of options. <br />
The benefit of using radio buttons over select is that users may easily scan the available options and make a quick selection.

## Anatomy 
The radio button (and other form controls) are divided in sections that are re-used between components.

- **Header**: Label, label support, contextual help, extended support.
- **Body**: The radio button.
- **Footer**: Error message.

## Features

### Label
All individual radio buttons must have a label to ensure clarity and accessibility. When radio buttons are grouped, the group must have a header label. Labels help users understand the purpose of the radio buttons, including those using assistive technologies.

### Label support 
This can be used for both the header and individual radio buttons. Use this to explain how to fill in the field, for example how to count or what to include. Contained radio buttons don’t have support text for the individual radio buttons.

</Grid>

### Contextual help
If the label and support text are not enough to explain a field, we can use the info icon.
Clicking the icon shows additional support text between the label support and the field.
- Use a tooltip if space is limited.
- Use a modal for large amounts of text.

</Grid>

### Error message
If an error occurs we mark the entire group of options with error. The error is described with an error message.

## Behaviour
- **Mutual exclusivity**: Only one radio button within a group can be selected at a time.
- **Defaults**: Aim for having one option pre-selected.

## Alignment
We can align the radio buttons both horizontal and vertical.
- **Vertical**: This is the default alignment. It's easier to read and scan the available options.
- **Horizontal**: Only used for a small set of options if the page shouldn't be to long, but try to avoid.

### Do
- Have at least two options.
</div>
<div>
### Don't
- Don’t use radio buttons for non-mutually exclusive options; consider checkboxes instead.
- Don’t overwhelm users with too many radio buttons on a single page or form. If you need to show many options, use a single select dropdown instead.
- Don’t mix default and contained versions.
