## Design
Simple and recognizable design. Rounded corners to keep relations with form fields and buttons. The contained design version adds more visual punch and should be used then forms need more impact on the page. 

## Anatomy
Group label is always on top follow by optional support text. Each checkbox has a label and optional support text.
