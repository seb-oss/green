1. Refactored the scale, removing `title` sizes in favor of `heading`.
2. Aligned size scale with `h1-h6`, corresponding to `heading-xl` through `heading-2xs`.
3. Imported and generate shadow tokens from the library.
4. Applied styles directly to the tag.
5. Added default styles for `h1-h6`, `paragraph`, and `strong` tags.
6. Implemented sanitization to ensure valid HTML tag names.
