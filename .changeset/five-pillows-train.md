**Dependencies:** Include React 19 in peer dependency constraint

This update makes it possible to use @sebgroup/green-react with React 19 without complaints from NPM.

Note, however, that the library is still not thoroughly tested with React 19, and all our unit tests still run against React 18. So proceed with caution.
