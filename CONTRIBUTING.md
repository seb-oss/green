# Contributing

Welcome! How wonderful to see you ❤️

The Green Design System is developed as an Inner Source project, meaning basically Open Source but constrained to one organization. This means we need you and, hopefully, you need us.

## Pilots

While the project is young and unexplored, we have chosen to focus our efforts by using pilots. If you are starting a new product or want to switch to `Green`, you might be our next pilot. We'll team up with you and assist you in the switch as well as building the components your product needs but that are missing from `Green`. The coding will be done partly by us but mostly by you. This is to ensure all teams using `Green` are familiar and comfortable with the product as well as active in keeping it fresh. This also ensure that we only build the components we need. No guessing.

Ping us on Teams in the channel `Green` if you are interested!

## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it, though! Look at the links below if you're not sure how to open a PR.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
1. Make sure you fulfill the technical pre-requisites

- Node version 14 or later
- Yarn (`npm install -g yarn`)
- git-cz (`npm install -g git-cz`)

1. Install the dependencies: `yarn`.
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `yarn test`, note: these tests also apply the linter, so there's no need to lint separately.
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-cool-component`.
1. Write the tests, write the code, and make sure the tests pass.
1. Add your changes and commit by running `git-cz`.
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
1. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the [style guide][style] which is using standard. Any linting errors should be shown when running `yarn test`.
- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a good commit message.
  - Use `git-cz` and select an appropriate commit type
  - Write an easy to understand description of your changes
  - If you have registered an issue, reference it with `#[issue number]` or `closes #[issue number]`if applicable

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you.
